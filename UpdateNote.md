 * All equipment items now have a `Quality` attribute that indicates the quality of the item, it allows players to know if they got a "good roll" when printing.
#### Major Rebalance
All the stats, level exp growth rate, enemy health, and damage, are all re-adjusted and should be (hopefully) more balanced.
However, this also meant we had to do a soft-reset on all players (meaning you keep your account and names, but stats and items are reset)
