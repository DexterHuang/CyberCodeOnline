## Upcoming Update Notice

Epic Equipment Exchange (Subject to change and player feedback):

- You can exchange 4 Epic Equipments to random amount of `Epic Cache Fragment`s base on random chances, currently set to from lowest 1 `Epic Cache Fragment` to highest 6 `Epic Cache Fragment`s (this is subjected to change base on feedback and testing)
- You can exchange 8 `Epic Cache Fragment` to 1 random Epic Equipment Cache
- The exchange will need to be activated with a global buff, this is to eliminate the worry of sudden influx of new epic cache into the market; this will slow down the rate of exchange, to reduce the shock to the market.

**Why?**
This is to address two frequently player requested features:

- Allowing players to change unwanted epic equipment cache type to other type
- Allowing players to exchange "bad epic rolls" to try again

Additionally, in the long term, this will:

- Reduce the amount of Epic Caches and Equipments in the market and encourages trade
- All exchanges will be less than 4 to 1 rate, so net amount of Epic Caches and Equipments will be reduced
- Introduce additional use for epic equipments that is unwanted for whatever reason deem as "bad epic rolls"
- caches of unwanted type can be printed then exchanged to become another type of cache
- Encourage buying of any type of epic cache since they now can be used in other way

**Feedback and suggestions are welcome**
Please send your feedback to my Discord or email directly.

  - English
  - Chinese
  - Japanese
  - Korean

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f14c50-7c1a-41da-b813-89bdc48e8f3b)

- During June, we are experimenting with a new event type where you can get event items just by chatting in Global; basically every 15 minutes if you chat in Global there is a random chance to get a event item, during cooldown, no matter how many message you sent, you will not gain chance to get event item.
  **Spamming will automatically exclude you from the event, and will NOT increase your chance to get the item at all due to the 15-minute cooldown**
  **The best way to participate is just to chat normally**
  **I may adjust the cooldown time based on situation if needed**

### 0.1869

- **Fixed Gifting Network Errors**: Resolved an issue where gifting items to other players occasionally resulted in a `Network Error`. The root cause has been identified and optimized to prevent recurrence.

You should now experience faster and more reliable gifting transactions.

**Pro Tip for Valuable Transactions**:  
To ensure a successful gifting process for high-value items, consider sending a small, low-value item first. This initial transaction caches data, significantly reducing the likelihood of failure for subsequent valuable items. Even if a network error occurs, your valuable item will remain secure.

- Tutorial will not show up on players who are higher level than 20, this is so that some people who for any reason always got their cache cleared won't need to see tutorial every time, while this is added, I would like to add, clearing cache does NOT improve speed for your device, cache saves battery life, reduce data usage and speed up your device; that is the primary function of caches

Please notify me if there is any bug with the updates 🫡🫡

### 0.1846

- Fixed pet age display issue, after Looooong search and many attempts trying to find why the leaderboard sometimes displays incorrect age for pets, I finally found a potential fix for it, the pet's age should display correctly now, and the calculation of age is more complicated then one may think due to various technical reasons, which causes it to be hard to track and display the age. hopefully, this fixes the issue, please report back to me if a similar issue continues to happen in the future :)
  Please keep in mind that leaderboard data is not real-time and delayed meaning the age you see there are not necessarily the same as how the owner sees it, for pet age, it's possible for the ranking to be lightly out of order in rare cases due to technical reasons.
  additionally, the leaderboard page UI is updated

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51acfa12-b945-445f-bc77-87cb58604704)

- Rewritten how the emblem list is displayed, all unavailable will show up in the list but has a `Unavailable` tag

### 0.1845

- Added new tier of backpack: `Quantum Storage Unit` similar to other backpack items, increases inventory slot drastically, this also serves as an optional late-game goal and a token to show off your wealth and standout against other players, You will also receive a backpack emblem for free when you crafted this item. **Given the item is a long-term collectable goal, we do not expect people to craft it any time soon, the exact requirement to craft this item is Subject to Change and is NOT FINAL, and we are open to lowering the crafting requirement based on the situation, and feedback or suggestions are welcome :) drop me a message on Discord or email**

### 0.1839

- Calibration Rework/Code Re-write:

  - A new line of community fundraising with different starting time of cali train will be added; there will be two fundraising options, one will start at 00:00 UTC and the other will start at 12:00 UTC, the two funds will be independent of each other. The intention is to give people more options to choose which fund to raise depending on their preferred schedule while providing a predictable timing. the current funding will carry on to the 00:00 UTC fund, and the 12:00 UTC fund will start from 0% when the update is live.
    ![image](https://github.com/DexterHuang/CyberCodeOnline/assets/18545294/9736f045-d6b6-48d5-a0fe-649e8ee3100c)

    _Note the image says 8am and 8pm because my timezone is UTC+8, it will show up differently according to your device timezone_

  - **The System will allow normal calibration buffs to be deployed even when there is a pending train**, until a short time before the train starts, to prevent it from interfering with the event train
  - 8 hours before any Cali Train starts, a banner will be shown on the chat screen, similar to Party Funds, to remind players of the upcoming train.
  - With the new system deploying calibration buffs will no longer require using of an item, the functionality will be integrated directly into the Calibration NPC UI Page (Kamiko), hence all calibration-related items will be retired from the game; **All Calibration related items will remain usable as normal if you already have them in your inventory before the update**, and they will no longer be obtainable from any source after the update. This is to simplify the user experience, reduce the complexity of the system. You will still be able to activate calibration buffs similar to before (without contributing to the cali train fund), just that you do not need to use items to do so, you can simply click on the interface to deploy individual cali buffs.

    ![image](https://github.com/DexterHuang/CyberCodeOnline/assets/18545294/f20c21c4-012b-4a3a-a5a5-54c4212a88ba)

  - When the funds are collected, the global party buff will be activated immediately, and the buff will last for 24 hours, the buff is the same as the existing global party buff
  - If a global buff is already active when a player tries to contribute the last bit of the fund, the server will not allow contribution until the buff ends, however you can freely contribute the fund as long as its not the last bit of the fund.
  - If a normal global buff (the activated by item) is used, it WILL NOT affect the global party contribution progress, the progress will continue as normal, the progress only resets when the last bit of the fund is contributed and the buff is activated by the community.

### Pet & Apartment System (Initial Beta, please report any bugs or suggestions to the Discord server)

- You can adopt pets, The pet system is aimed towards a **Role-Play** element instead of adding combat/stat-related mechanics to avoid adding a traditional "Gacha" system which understandably many people want to avoid; instead, pets will adopt a more "Tamagotchi" style of gameplay (Tamagotchi is a type of simulation game where you take care of a virtual pet. very popular in the 90s), you will need to feed, play, and take care of your pet when they are sick to keep them happy and healthy.
- You will be able to check out other players' pets and you can tag your pet by mentioning them in chat to show it to other players, similar to how you mention other players. in the initial version of the pet system, you can play with other players' pets, but you cannot feed them or clean them, that will be the owner's responsibility.
- Taking care of your pet: Pets will have a hunger, happiness and cleanness meter, and a hidden healthiness meter, when the pet is too hungry, unhappy or dirty, it will correspondingly affect their mood, if you continue to neglect your pet, it will get sick and eventually die, you can take care of your pet by feeding them, playing with them, cleaning them and giving them medicine when they are sick.
- Obtaining pets: continuing the unique theme of CyberCode Online emphasis on no pay-to-win, the items required to redeem pets will be obtainable through `Pet Shelter Volunteer Shift AFK` activity and Global Buff similar to how Calibration currently works. by doing this task there will be a chance of receiving:
  - `Paw Credit`, You can use it to redeem pet-related items from the pet shelter
  - `Volunteer Service Medallion`, you combine 10 of these to get one `Sanctuary Adoption Pass` which you can use to adopt a pet when `Adoption Buff` is activated by any player.
- Pet types: it is planned to have two types of pets at the initial launch; cats and dogs, each type will have hundreds of different images based on breeds and colors, and the image of the pets will be determined randomly when you adopt the pet(more types of pets are expected to be added in the future, suggestions are welcomed). you can also randomly change the cosmetic image of your pet without changing the pet's data such as type, hunger, happiness, name and age by using Unit.
- what happens if your pet dies: if unfortunately your pet dies, you can adopt a new pet or you can choose to activate `Revival Buff` Global Buff to revive your pet and anyone who chooses to revive their pet during the buff duration. there will be cooldowns for reviving pets to ensure that one revival buff can only revive one pet per player.
- Apartments: You can rent apartments with BTC, and the rental fee is weekly based, if you don't have enough BTC in your account when the rental fee is due, you will be evicted from the apartment. there will be different tiers of apartments, each tier allows you to have bigger 'spaces' for your pet. currently apartment serves as a place that allows you to own pets (you must have an apartment to own a pet) and for future updates.
- Apartment restrictions: you can only have one apartment per account, and you must be at least level 100, as renting an apartment requires you to have some amount of excess BTC, this is to ensure that new players won't spend their hard-earned BTC on renting an apartment and then regret it later. at the same time encourages players to level up and serve as a progression milestone.
- Apartment on market: every day there will be random apartments available for rent on the market, with different appearances, addresses and price
