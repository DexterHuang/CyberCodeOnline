### 2022/02/11 v0.780 
- UI - Updated Weapons Smith chracter - keeps the original design by OG l33t4ng3l while aligning the art style with rest of NPCs 
- Minigame Enabled
- Why? isnt there many important bugs or feature to add?
  - Because this is one of the more important things to add. This feature is aimed to address several different issues:
  - To increase the difficulty of making dungeon auto farm bot/scripts, to also reduce server load created by botters, also reduce the time I spend banning them.
  - Increase dungeon variety, this is the first step of a series of elements I want to add into dungeons making them more interesting. From choiced based events to minigames like this, dungeons being only "keep fighting enemies non-stop" is one of the constructive criticism I receive from players.
  - Adds a tiny bit of skill based element to the game, currently dungeon crawlers are differentiated by how fast your internet is and are able to click the buttons faster. This way even if your goal is to speed-run dungeons, whoever runs faster will be determinded by an individual's skill rather then how fast their internet/server is. Overal this should be fair to everyone.

- How long does it take to finish the minigame?
  - It should take under a minute, even if you are very bad at video games, it will be easy enough for all players, but you will play better if you are more skilled.

- Is there a reward if you beat the minigame? 
  - Yes, my plan is to increase the reward for minigame.

- Is this all Permanent and not subject to change?
  - Absolutly NOT. If you think it should be adjusted or anything after its deployment, please be involved in discussion with other players, Myself and the Moderators in the Discord, so that we can make adjustments to mimprove playability. I do not expect it to be perfect on launch so nor should you :) 
**So, please do not feakout and be super ultra instinct angry if you dont like some part of it** just join the discussion and I will always hear it.

- Why put up notice? is this a HUGE update?
  - No, not at all, it shouldnt matter too much actually it is because I am worried that players may get mad when they see changes happen without being giving me or the game some time to fix stuff.

This is to ensure that each of the `RNG Interferer` is only one use, to mitigate the issue of sometimes skip takes longer to finish base on server status and amount of players; this way, the value of `RNG Interferer` stays exactly the same regardless of how many people are skipping or how fast the server is skipping players.
