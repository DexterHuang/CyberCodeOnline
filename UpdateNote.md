 * selling item amount slider now maxed at the amount you have
 * fix dungeon size

### **18/08/2020 - v0.05**

#### Dungeon Update
 * added dungeons to each level segment in the map
 * added convenient store in the main city
 * added serval healing items, you can purchase them at a convenience store
 * in dungeons, the player's health will not automatically heal to max once out of combat
 * players can collaborate on dungeons to more easily defeat it (they're harder as you don't regen)
 * higher-level regions now require `SecretKey` to access, `SecretKey`s need to crafted by combining 3 different `SecretKeyFragment`s which can be acquired at the end of each dungeon.
#### Item Update
 * Now you can compare any time with the one you are wearing
 * All equipment items now have a `Quality` attribute that indicates the quality of the item, it allows players to know if they got a "good roll" when printing.
#### Major Rebalance
All the stats, level exp growth rate, enemy health, and damage, are all re-adjusted and should be (hopefully) more balanced.
However, this also meant we had to do a soft-reset on all players (meaning you keep your account and names, but stats and items are reset)
