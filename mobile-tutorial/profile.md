At the [STATS] you can see the 'Global Effects' of an activated Transmitter (whether it is a Synaptic Accelerator, Exploit or Frontal Cortex Optimization one).

Here you can also see how long the [MUTED] status will last.

As the name suggests, someone with the 'MUTED' status will have the ability to comunicate with others disabled for a certain amount of time.

'MUTED' status affects all kinds of chats, both Global, Gang and Mail (Private Messaging).

'MUTED' status does not affect the ability to receive or send items to other players or the ability to play the game. You will be able to continue to play the game but without the interaction with other players.

The 'MUTED' status is applied by the moderators (mods) to a player who broke the rules of the game or the ones related to the chat. 

**You will need to scroll down below stats to see these**

- [DONATE] - which will take you to the Donation Tiers;

- [QUIT GANG] - in case you are in a gang;

- [LOGOUT] - this will log you out of the game.

On other players profile, you will encounter different options:
- [SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE] - it allows you to send a private message through the in-game Mail.

- [SEND GIFT] - it allows you to send items (caches, healing items, ammo etc.) from your inventory to the other players inventory. You cannot send Secret Key Fragments to other players.

- [INVITE TO GANG] - you can invite the player only if you are the leader of the gang or you, as the leader, gave permission to each gang members to invite others players into the gang.

- [ADD TO FRIEND LIST] - this will simply add the player to your friend list (without needing an acceptance from the player) and if the player is not inside the game, they will also receive a notification about the fact that you added him/her as friend.

- [SEND STREET CRED] - this allows you to give 1 Street Cred point to other players.

Street Cred is a point system similar to the "karma" one found on Reddit. It's meant to indicate how trustful or helpful a player is.

## Types of levels

### Player Level

This is where all your other levels will be capped at. You can increase your player level by fighting in dungeons, fighting enemies and using Experience Memories. For the highest efficiency you want to keep all your levels in-line with your player level (This is recommended).

### Printing Rank

You can level your printing rank by printing equipment, either by Reverse Engineering Tech Scraps or Working at a Printing Factory (These are all AFK jobs) at the Job Hub. 

### Medical Science
Crafting medical items or intiating a job at the Job Hub will give you medical crafting experience. You will need these levels to craft better heal items.

### Ammo Crafting

### Scavenge Skill

To start Scavenging, you must start scavenging from the lower levels areas (Flori Station, Grandiose Parking Lot 1 - 4) up to the higher ones. 

Higher scavenge level will allow you to scavenge for (ammunition, military ammunition and medical) tech parts in higher level locations, which will grant you better rewards. You gain scavenge experience by scavenging.

### Mining Skill

Mining can be done only with 'Hash Processors' that drops from both normal and challenge dungeons.

Higher mining level can earn you more BTC per 15 minutes of afk mining, that being the minimum duration at which you can start mining. You can get mining experience by completing the mining job. With higher mining levels, you can craft AI cores more efficiently.
