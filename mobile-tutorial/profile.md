Here is what you can see from your profile
 - Alias

 - Amount of BitCoins
 - Average gear level (Gear Score)

 - Online/Offline status (System Link)

In the [STATS] section, you can see the 'Global Effects' of an activated Transmitter (or boost).

Here you can also see how long the [MUTED] status will last.

As the name suggests, someone with the 'MUTED' status will not be able to communication with others for a certain amount of time.

The 'MUTED' status affects all kinds of chats: both Global, Gang and Mail (Private Messaging).

The 'MUTED' status does not affect the ability to receive or send items to other players or the ability to play the game.

The 'MUTED' status is applied by the moderators (mods) to a player who has broken the rules of the game or the ones related to the chat. 

At the bottom of your profile, you will see a few additional options:

- [DONATE] - this will take you to the donation tiers (Cosmetics);

- [QUIT GANG] - this will leave your gang, if you are in one;

- [LOGOUT] - this will log you out of the game.

On other players' profiles, you will encounter different options:

- [SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE] - send a private message to the player through in-game Mail.

- [SEND GIFT] - send items (caches, healing items, ammo, etc.) from your inventory to the other player's inventory. You cannot send Secret Key Fragments to other players.

- [INVITE TO GANG] - invite the player to your gang, only if you are the Leader or you have the permission to invite others players into the gang.

- [ADD TO FRIEND LIST] - add the player to your friend list, and if the player is not currenty online, they will also receive a notification about the fact that you added them as a friend.

- [SEND STREET CRED] - give 1 Street Cred point to the player.

Street Cred is a point system similar to "Karma" found on Reddit. It's meant to indicate how trustful or helpful a player is.

You're limited to sending only 1 Street Cred per day. You are not limited in how much Street Cred you receive from other players.

## Types of levels

### Player Level

This is the level all your other skills will be capped at. You can increase your player level by fighting in dungeons, fighting enemies and using Experience Memories. For the highest efficiency, you want to keep all your levels about even with your player level. This is recommended.

### Printing Rank

Printing rank determines the level of the equipment you will print at the 3D Molecular Printer. You can level your printing rank by printing equipment, Reverse Engineering Tech Scraps or working at a Printing Factory. The latter two options are AFK jobs at the Job Hub.

### Medical Science
Crafting medical items or initiating the relevant job at the Job Hub will give you medical crafting experience. You will need these levels to craft better healing items.

### Ammo Crafting

Crafting ammo or initiating a job at the Job Hub will give you ammo crafting experience. It's useful to craft more ammo with less materials.

### Scavenge Skill

To start scavenging, you must start at the lowest level area (Flori Station, Grandiose Parking Lot 1 - 4). As your scavenge skill improves, you can start to scavenge at higher levels. The level requirements are listed in those areas.

Higher scavenge levels will also grant you better rewards of (ammunition, military ammunition and medical) tech parts. You can only gain scavenge experience by scavenging.

### Mining Skill

Mining can be done only with 'Hash Processors' that drop from both normal and challenge dungeons.

Higher mining levels can earn you more BTC per 15 minutes of AFK mining. You can get mining experience by completing mining jobs at the Job Hub. With higher mining levels, you can craft AI cores more efficiently as well.
