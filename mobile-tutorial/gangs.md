## Gangs
Gangs are a great way to join forces with your friends.  Members gain the ability to access gang headquarters, dungeons, and chat. Gangs can be created and joined once you're level 3.  Creating a gang costs 50,000BTC and then has a weekly upkeep fee of resources and BTC.  

## Gang HQ
The gang headquarters show your gang level, necessary upkeep, amount of members, and control over Shangri-La.  It also has new AFK tasks and an automatic recycler.  

Gang level impacts how many members can be in a gang.  To level up, collect gang Exp with the AFK tasks 'Gather Gang Resource' and 'Decrypt Memory Shard'.  There is a leaderboard for gangs, ranked by level.

There's a weekly upkeep due for all gangs. If the upkeep quota isn't met, the gang will be automatically disbanded.  Upkeep amounts are based on the number of members the gang has -- so the more members there are, the more resources and BitCoin are needed.  Minimize the amount of inactive players in your gang to keep upkeep goals lower.

Occupation gives gangs control over different areas of Shangri-La.  If a gang is in the top two gangs on the Occupation Leaderboard, those members have access to a task called 'Collect Protection Fees'.  Control is gained by performing the 'Reinforce Occupation at Shangri-La' task, which consumes one gang supply crate.  It is recommended to discuss with your gang whether you want to gather occupation points or not.

The automatic recycler will break down various items like med tech or caches into tech scrap. This can be an efficient way to create tech scrap.  Each item that's being recycled has a different timer and tech scrap payout, so be sure to consider the return on tech scrap and time.  

The final AFK task available to gang members is 'Hack SL Data Fortress'.  This task uses Protocal Breach Shards to make progress on the SL-Data Fortress Breach.  Total progress can be seen in the Quest tab.  When a Breach has been completed, a global buff will go into effect.  

## Gang Dungeons
Gang dungeon consumes a Gang Invasion Order Transmitter when being created.  After the dungeon has been created, anyone in the gang can join, regardless of their level. Enemies are 4-5x stronger than regular enemies and give 2x the exp.  Bosses are guaranteed to drop a Rare Locked Container, Rare equipment, and some Gang Supply Crates.

As Gang Leader, you will have 3 additional options when visiting one of your gang members' profiles:
 - [KICK] - you can kick the gang member from the gang;
 - [PERMISSIONS] - here you can grant permissions to the gang member:
   - Invite - it allows the gang member to invite other players to the gang;
   - Kick  - it allows the gang member to kick other gang members;
   - Manage - it allows the gang member to add or remove other gang members' permissions.
 - [TRANSFER LEADERSHIP] - you can set another gang member as the leader in case you don't want to be the leader anymore or want to leave the gang.

Also as the Leader, in the Gang chat, if you click on the numbers of players in the gang on the top right, you will be able to [DELETE GANG] there.
