### What is this game, what do I do?
Basically you adventure around these 'Train Stations' and either defeating individual enemies or entire dungeons. You'll randomly receive items, equipment or caches after defeating enemies. **It is compulsory to receive BTC and EXP after each battle, but items/equipment/caches don't drop after every single battle.**

### Is this game P2W (Pay-to-Win)?
No. There's no element in this game that would benefit or offer additional advantages to some players over the others.

Even the Transmitters sold in the Arasaka Unit Exchange have a global effect, which means once its activated all players one the server will benefit from the effect that it gives.

The developer intends to keep the game non-P2W in the future.

The caches you get scale only to your Printing Rank.
It doesn't matter if you print your caches now or later.

The only caches that are recommended to keep for later levels (lvl 30 - 40+) are the Legendary ones and of course, Epic ones, if it ever happens to get one as a drop.

You can also get Bitcoins by selling caches, gear, crafting itmes and other types of items in the Player Market.

They are special items that can be bought only with Units (premium currency).
The only exception is with the normal afk transmitter that drops from dungeons and can reduce the afk time only to 5%.
They have a global effect meaning that once activated all players on the server benefits their effects.
Their effects can range from reducing the time on an afk job or activity to increased BTC gain.

You can repair your equipment by paying a small amount of BTC at the Weaponsmith which you can find in the City Centre.

### Can I upgrade or level up my weapons and armours?

You can however print new weapons and armours or buy them off from Player Market.

### Can I remove installed upgrade modules?
Yes. Just click on the installed upgrade module to remove it from the equipment.

### What "Quality" on weapons and armor means?
The quality of the armor will contribute a lot on the stat it gives, the higher the quality and better then stats.
No, you can't change the Quality of an weapon or armor.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will have the same level as the one from your 'Printing Rank'. It does not scale with player level.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.  

2. AFK Printing Training. There is an AFK job in the Commercial Area called 'Work in Printing Factory' that increases your printing rank. 

3. Reverse engineering Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is a short AFK job called 'Reverse Engineer Scraps' which uses Tech Scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches, select the gear (you can select multiple items at once and then scrap them for Tech Scraps)

You will lose some of your experience and BTC (around 10%), however your inventory will be safe.

Instead of making your dungeon private, you can choose instead to protect it with a password by swiping the 'Dungeon password' button to active and type a password.

Password protected dungeons can be seen by other players but they cannot join unless they know what the password is.
