### What is this game, and what do I do?
Basically you adventure around 'Train Stations' and either defeat individual enemies or conquer entire dungeons.
You'll randomly receive items, equipment or caches after defeating enemies.

**You will receive BTC and EXP inside a battle, but items won't drop after every single battle.**

### Is this game P2W (Pay-to-Win)?
No. There's no element in this game that would benefit or offer additional advantages to some players over others.

The Transmitters sold in the Arasaka Unit Exchange have a global effect, which means once it is activated, all players on the server will benefit from the effect that it gives. Similarly, the Global Skips that can be purchased apply to all players who have started AFK tasks.

The developer intends to keep the game non-P2W into the future.

Yup 🤠 ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ.

Please don't overuse or spam these, as this kind of practice is against the Chat Rules.

### Does this game have PvP?
No. PvP is not currently available in the game.

### What is the fastest way to level up in this game?
The fastest and best way to level up in this game is to have an Frontal Cortex Transmitter (XP booster) active and to complete challenge dungeons.

### What will happen if I die?
You will lose some of your experience and BTC (around 10%); however your inventory will be safe.

### Where is the Player Market?
When your character reaches level 5, the player market will be unlocked.  
It will show up as a new destination in the 'Central Hub'.

### Does the game support trading among players?
Yes, partially. You can send items to other players, but there isn't a system that forces the other person to give something in exchange. Most trades are conducted with trust.

You can't gift BTC and key fragments to other players.

Only healing items, ammo, materials, Hash Processors, Ai Cores and other types of items.

### What should I do if my inventory is full?
You can either scrap, destroy or store items in the bank located in the City Center. Note that the fee for each item you deposit in the bank is 100 BTC. It doesn't cost anything to take the item back out.

You can also temporarily increase your inventory capacity with the 'Pocket' stat found on equipment and upgrade modules.

### How do I craft items?
At the top of the Inventory page, you will find a tab called 'Crafting'.

### Where can I get healing items?
Healing items can be crafted, found when defeating an enemy or when looting a crate in a dungeon, or purchased at the Trinoky Mart in the City Center.  
They can also be purchased from the Player Market.

### Why my Special and Destructive weapons have no ammo?
Special weapon uses Energy Cells and Destructive, Anti-Matter Charges.  
Both these kind of ammo need to be either looted from enemies or crafted in the Crafting tab, inside Inventory.

### Can I upgrade or level up my weapons and armour?
You can't modify the rarity (e.g. from Rare to Legendary) of a weapon or armour, nor you can level up your old weapons or armours to your current level.
You can however print new weapons and armours or buy them from the Player Market.

### What does "Quality" on weapons and armor means?
The quality of the armor will contribute a lot on the stat it gives; the higher the quality, the better the stats.
You cannot change the Quality of a weapon or armor.

### What does "Durability" on weapons and armor means?
Durability is the ability of an equipment to remain functional, without requiring excessive maintenance or repair, when faced with the challenges of normal operation over it's designed lifetime. (Wikipedia)

### How do I repair my equipment's durability?
You can repair your equipment by paying a small amount of BTC at the Weaponsmith which you can find in the City Center.

### Can I remove installed upgrade modules?
Yes. Just click on the installed upgrade module to remove it from the equipment.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will have the same level as the one from your 'Printing Rank'. It does not scale with player level.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.

2. AFK Printing Training. There is an AFK job in the Commercial Area called 'Work in Printing Factory' that increases your printing rank.

3. Reverse engineering Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is a short AFK job called 'Reverse Engineer Scraps' which uses Tech Scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank. By printing caches then scrapping them for Tech Scraps, you'll be able to level up your printing rank quickly.

### What are caches and what should I do with them?
You can use them to craft equipment at the Molecular 3D Printer.

### Do caches scale with my level? Should I keep them for later?
The caches you get scale only to your Printing Rank.
The gear that you obtain from them, whether weapons, armor or upgrade modules, will always have the same level as your Printing Rank. Make sure to level your Printing Rank to your current player level to always receive the best equipment possible from printing.

It doesn't matter if you print your caches now or later, but it's recommended to keep for later levels (lvl 30 - 40+) the Legendary and Epic ones, if you ever happen to find them as drops.
Legendary and Epic caches are much more expensive to craft than Rare ones, but the items have much better stats so the equipment will be relevant to you longer. If you have a set of Legendary equipment, you won't be switching off too soon.

### Will higher level enemies give more rewards?
Yes. Higher level enemies give you more BTC and experience after you defeat them.

### What are Locked Containers and how do I unlock them?
Locked containers (✧) are special crates that can be found and picked up from dungeons and can be unlocked using Tech Scraps at the Terminal in the main HUB.
They contain various rewards from Tech Scraps to Legendary gear.

Depending on the quality of the locked container, the amount of Tech Scrap needed for unlocking it depends on the quality of the container, starting from 32 Tech Scraps for common containers, 64 for rare containers and 128 for legendary ones.

If you don't see the option for unlocking the container at the Terminal, it means you do not have enough Tech Scraps.

### What is BitCoin (BTC) and how do I redeem it?
BitCoin (BTC) is just the game's currency, so the BitCoin here isn't the same as the one from the real world. (We would all be richer than Elon Musk if it was equivalent.)

### How do I get more BitCoins?
You can get more by mining with 'Hash Processors' (that drop from dungeons) at the [Job Hub].
You can also get BitCoins by selling items in the Player Market or receiving them from defeating mobs or dungeons.

### What is Street Cred?
Street Cred (Street Credit) is a way to appreciate someone you like or who has helped you. They are similar to "Karma" points on Reddit.

You can give only 1 Street Cred per day. To give Street Cred, all you have to do is to go to the person's profile, scroll down to 'Player Actions' and click on [GIVE STREET CRED] located under [ADD TO FRIEND LIST].

You should consider giving some Street Credit to the people that contributed to this game. You can view the list at Profile - > Credits.

### What are Gangs and how do I create one?
Gangs are the equivalent of clans or guilds in other MMORPGs.

You can create one if you go to Chat, then the Gang tab and pay 100,000 BTC.

Gangs allow you to have a tag of 3 letters, chosen when the gang was created, in your chat border.

Players that are in gangs can access a much higher difficulty dungeon, a gang dungeon, with guaranteed rare quality cache drops or higher.
The gang dungeon can be accessed only with a Gang Transmitter found in challenge dungeons.

### How do I search for a Gang? How do I join one?
Currently, you can't see a list of gangs in the game.
You can join one by creating it yourself or by receiving an invite from the Gang Leader or a gang member granted permissions to invite others to the gang.

### Can I rename my Gang? Can I have the same tag as another Gang has?
Currently, you can't rename your own gang.
It's forbidden to have the same tag as other gangs.
All gangs should have different tags in order to avoid confusion.

### How can I level up my gang?
To be able to maintain your gang and to level it up, each member of the gang will have to gather resources (through an AFK task in the Gang Headquarters) and will also have to donate bitcoins to it.

### Where's my gang headquarters (HQ)? What can I do there?
Gang HQ is located in the main HUB, under [Player Market].

Here you can donate bitcoins and gather resources for the upkeep of your gang.

Here you can also decrypt Memory Shards that will give an equipment cache, mining EXP and gang EXP.

### What do all the different symbols mean in dungeons?
- "?" represents a "good guy" giving a quest. You can access accepted quests in your Quest tab.
- "!" represents lore.
- Crates are represented by small white boxes. There are special crates containing key fragments as well.
- The yellow ✧ is a crate containing a locked container.
- The alien looking icons represent monsters inside the dungeon.

### What are Public and Private Dungeons? What are Password Protected Dungeons?
A dungeon is Public by default when creating one. Public Dungeons are available to everyone to see and join (if they meet the level requirements) by accessing the list of dungeons.
You can make the dungeon Private so that it's invisible to other players and only you can play in the dungeon.

Instead of making your dungeon private, you can choose to protect it with a password by swiping the 'Dungeon password' button to activate and type in a password.

Password protected dungeons can be seen by other players but they cannot join unless they know the password. This is useful if you want to clear a dungeon with specific friends. Just share the password in Gang chat or through Mail.

### People are looting my stuff. Help!
The loot in the dungeons is instanced for each player, meaning that the loot in the crates is randomly generated for each player.
Therefore is impossible for someone to steal your loot.

### What are Tech Scraps?
Tech Scraps are resources obtained from scrapping caches and printed gear.

They can be used to level up Printing Rank faster, to craft Ai Cores and Hash Processors and to unlock Locked Containers.

The best way to get Tech Scrap is to mass print Trash Caches or Common Caches and then mass scrap the obtained gear.

### What are AI Cores?
AI Cores are items required to AFK farm dungeons. Basically they allow you to farm EXP, items and a small amount of BTC. They can be acquired as drops or crafted from Hash Processors.

### What are Hash Processors?
Hash Processors ('hash' for short) are items that are required to activate an AFK job that yields high amounts of BTC (BitCoin). They drop from normal and challenge dungeons.

### What are Gang Memory Shards?
Upon deciphering them, these items will give you a random cache, mining experience and gang experience.

### What are Gang Invasion Transmitters?
Gang invasion transmitters are special items that drops only from a boss of a challenge dungeon.
They are required to be able to open a Gang Dungeon.
Everyone who wishes to enter in the Gang Dungeon will have to have a Gang Invasion Transmitter in their inventory.

### What are Transmitters?
These are special items that can be bought only with Units (premium currency) and provide global benefits to all players on the server.

The only exception is the normal transmitter that drops from dungeons, which is less effective than the paid versions.

Their effects range from reducing the time on AFK job or activities to increasing BTC or EXP gain.

### What's the benefit of leveling my crafting skills?
Your crafting skills allow you to create useful consumables, including medicine and ammo.
Higher levels allow you to craft more types of items and also craft more efficiently. For example, higher-level healing items will heal for more health.

### How do I increase my Scavenge Skill?
In every area with enemies, there is an action called AFK Resource Gather near the bottom of the list.
It's located under the dungeon selections.
You'll need to increase your scavenging level starting from earlier train stations (Level 1 - 4) before being able to scavenge at higher level sites.

### What's mining and how do I increase my mining skill?
Mining is the skill that allows you to farm BTC (BitCoin) more easily.
It also allows you to craft level 10 and level 20 AI Cores.
To mine, you need to have Hash Processors which drop from dungeons.
If you want to start mining, simply go to the [Job Hub] and scroll down until you see the option to mine.

### What is the Gear Score?
Gear Score is the average level of the equipment you wear. This doesn't take into account anything but the equipment levels.

### What is the Pocket Stat?
Pockets increase your inventory size. 1 pocket means 1 additional inventory slot.

### What is the Bargain Stat?
Bargain gives you better deals at the Weapon Smith and Trinoky Mart, which can be found in the Central Hub. You can both sell and buy your items for better prices.
