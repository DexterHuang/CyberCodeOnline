# **Keys**
You can obtain key fragments in dungeons. By completing and obtaining all fragments
of the same sector, you can merge it into a key by brute-foece at terminal. Once you
own the key you can access the corresponding sector.

**Flori > Kashi > Yamesa > Floranda > Akisarao**
Each sector includes a range of levels, when your gear score is higher than recommended
level you will not receive rewards from fighting enemies in dungeon. If your gear score
is much higher, you cannot interact with objects in that dungeon.
You can check your gear score at 'me' tab at bottom right corner.
