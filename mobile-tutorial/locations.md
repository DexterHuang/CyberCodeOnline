## Locations
The game begins in Shangri-La City Center. From there, you can explore various areas by going to different subway stations. 

## City Map

![Map](/resources/mobile-tutorial/Map.png)

## Shangri-La City Center  
![Shangri-La City Center](/resources/mobile-tutorial/Shangri-LaCityCenter.png)  
This is the Main HUB to which you will often return to after you die, to print equipment, to make purchases and for various other activities.

## 3D Molecular Printer  
![3D Molecular Printer](/resources/mobile-tutorial/Molecular3DPrinter.png)  
In the City Center, you can find the Molecular 3D Printer, which will be used to print your equipment from various caches.

Clicking on the printer option will bring you to the printing panel which lists all the caches you have.  
It costs BitCoin to print, so make sure you have enough. All details including BTC cost and printing experience given will be listed on the cache printing panel.  
If you wish to print a cache, all you need to do is to click on the cache you wish to print. If you have multiple caches of the same quality and type, it will bring up a dialog asking how many you want to print.  

A good strategy is to print all the trash items first then the common, saving rare, legendary and epic for later levels. The reason for this is that printing trash and common quality items first will provide you with printing experience; these items can then be scrapped to acquire Tech Scraps, which can also boost your Printing Level or be used to craft other items and unlock locked containers.

## Weaponsmith  
![Weaponsmith](/resources/mobile-tutorial/WeaponSmith.png)  
The Weaponsmith is a vendor in Shangri-La City Center who has items for sale and allows you to sell your items for BTC. You will see the items available for sale at the top. You can click on any of them and choose Buy if you can afford them.  
If you have equipment with the **bargain** stat, you will get a better deal.  

If you want to sell something to the Weaponsmith, you will need to open your inventory, click on any item you wish to sell and choose the Sell option. For some items, it may be more worth it to sell them at the player market.

You can repair your items here too. You lose durability the more you use your equipment. It costs very little to repair them to mint condition, so be sure to repair frequently as needed.

## Trinoky Mart  
![Trinoky Mart](/resources/mobile-tutorial/TrinokyMart.png)  
Here you can buy medical items with BTC. Prices are completely separate from the player market, so be sure to check both!  

## Terminal 
![Terminal](/resources/mobile-tutorial/Terminal.png)  
The terminal is used to merge key fragments into secret keys to unlock higher-level train stations.

Here you can also unlock locked containers (found in dungeons) with the Tech Scrap that you have.

## Bank of Arasaka
![Bank of Arasaka](/resources/mobile-tutorial/BankOfArasaka.png)  
In addition to your inventory, each player also has access to a vault in the Shangri-La State Bank.

Initially you have 6 bank slots. You can choose to permanently expand slots by paying BTC. Keep in mind that the cost of the slots you buy will increase with each purchase.  

Items that are stackable will occupy only one bank slot just like in your inventory. Each deposit will cost 100 BTC, but taking something out is free of charge.  

## Hyper Train Central Station  
![Hyper Train Station](/resources/mobile-tutorial/HyperTrainCentralStation.png)  
This is where your adventure begins. The train can take you to multiple stations. Each station has three areas full of enemies of different levels. This is also where you will find dungeons. Gather 3 unique key fragments from the dungeons to unlock the next train station.  

In each station, you can also use your AI Cores to farm EXP and scavenge for materials that are needed for crafting healing items and ammo.

## Shangri-La Commercial Area (Job Hub)  
![Commercial Area](/resources/mobile-tutorial/Shangri-LaCommercialArea.png)  
At this location, you can look for jobs to increase your printing level, ammo/medical crafting levels, and mining level. Each job (AFK activity) contains details on what you can accomplish with it.

## Shangri-La Market Street  
![Street Market](/resources/mobile-tutorial/Shangri-laMarketStreet.png)  
Here you can sell and purchase items to and from other players within the game for BTC.  

Keep in mind that whenever you want to sell or buy an item on the market, you will have to complete a captcha of 4 numbers.  
This is in place to prevent bots from using and manipulating the player market.

## Cosmetic Cyberwear  
![Cosmetic Cyberwear](/resources/mobile-tutorial/CosmeticCyberwear.png)  
In this location you can buy in-game subscriptions for real money.  

These subscriptions help maintain the cost of the game and allows you, depending on the type of subscription, to have a coloured chat border, a background animation for your profile, a title and the ability to upload a custom profile picture.

Please keep in mind that you are not forced to purchase these subscriptions at all and **these subscriptions offer no P2W benefits**.  
These subscription benefits are purely cosmetic.  
You can still play the game without subscribing.

## Arasaka Unit Exchange
![Arasaka Exchange](/resources/mobile-tutorial/ArasakaUnitExchange.png)  
Here you can buy Transmitters that have various effects. These Transmitters are purchaseable only with Units (premium currency).  

Keep in mind that if one player activates a Transmitter, every player on the server will benefit from it.  
**They are not P2W.**  
They can't offer an advantage to only one player. Everyone benefits from the effects.  

Here you can also purchase Units, the in-game premium currency, with real money.
In the Android/Apple application, the prices of Units will appear in your local currency.  
In the browser version (both mobile or desktop views), the prices will appear in USD only.
