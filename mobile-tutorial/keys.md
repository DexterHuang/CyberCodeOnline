## Secret Keys
Leveling areas of the game are called 'Stations'. Each Station has 3 other mini-areas and each of them have a normal and challenge dungeons. Every dungeon has a boss room, with either lots of tough mobs which are way higher than your level or a super boss which has a lot of hitpoints and potentially dealing the same damage as your hitpoints. After defeating all of them you will find a key fragment which is represented by a window logo in the room. Once you have all 3 fragments you can craft a Secret Key at the Terminal, which is found in the Shangri-La City Center (main HUB area of the game). Each Secret Key will grant you acess to a new Station and a new list of leveled enemies and dungeons to explore.  

Additional key fragments can be either discarded (in a dungeon) or destroyed (from inventory).

Key fragments cannot be sent to other people nor be sold on the Player Market.

This is the main progression of the game and dungeons will continue to level with you. However, if your player level is 10 levels below the dungeon's recommended level or more than 12 levels, you won't be able to join it. If you are 12 levels above the recommended dungeon level, you won't be able to interact with anything, including doors, quest givers or loot.
