### What is this game, what do I do?
To begin with travel to the 'Hyper Train Central Station' then start in the lvl 1 area and beat up some bad guys. You will slowly accumulate wepons, armour and levels to take on the dungeons and harder areas.
When your character reaches level 5 player market will be unlocked where you can purchase and sell items with BTC.
