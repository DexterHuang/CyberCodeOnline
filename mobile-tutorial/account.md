## Creating an Account

Currently you are able to use google, apple or create a new account to sign in. Simply click on the google or apple buttons to register with your respective accounts. However if you would like to create an account just for CyberCode Online, type in your email address and choose a password then click 'register'.

You will then be taken to a screen asking you to pick a player name. Make sure you think hard as this cannot be changed later. Then click confirm.


## Logging in

If you have already made an account, click "have an account" at the bottom of the page. Here you will then be able to sign in with your email and password or click the buttons to use google or apple.
