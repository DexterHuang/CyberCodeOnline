## Inventory

You can access your inventory by clicking the option at the bottom menu bar. In your inventory, you can see all items that you own, including gears, upgrade modules, ammo, medical items, secret keys, cache, and other consumables. By clicking on the item, you can see the details of that item.  

You can choose to equip your gear by clicking the equip button. Equipped gear will be highlighted on the top of the inventory page. By clicking on gears, you can choose to install upgrade modules that will enhance certain values of that gear.  

To remove installed upgrade modules, simply click on the installed module. Better quality gear have more upgrade module slots than lower quality gear.  

## Items in your Inventory

Your cache in your inventory can be consumed to print out gear using the Molecular 3D Printer in the City Centre.  

Medical items can be consumed in dungeons to regenerate health (since your character cannot automatically regenerate health in dungeons).  

Ammo can be used to perform special attacks and destructive attacks during combat.

Secret key fragments that you obtained in dungeon chests can be merged into a secret key by brute-forcing it in the Terminal. Secret keys will grant you access to higher level enemy spawns and dungeons.  

Other consumables, for example Hash Processors and AI Cores can be used to perform AFK tasks.

## Functions in your Inventory

By clicking the icons above your inventory list, you can filter out specific items. You will have 50 empty slots, equipping gears with extra pocket status will give you more inventory space. To get rid of gears and upgrade modules, you can click on the **scrap** button. Every item scrapped will give you a tech scrap. To get rid of other items, you can click on the **destroy** button. Destroyed items will not give you anything in return so be cautious when performing this action.  

## Item Inbox

Items that other players send will be automatically placed in your item inbox and will be automatically be moved to your main inventory when you have enough space for these items.

## Crafting

This tab in your inventory allows you to craft three different types of items: medical, ammo, and material. Medical crafting uses medical tech parts. Ammo crafting uses both ammo tech parts and military ammo tech parts. Material crafting uses hash processor and turns them into ai cores. As you level up the relevant skills (medical science, ammo crafting, and mining) you will open new recipes and be more proficient, allowing you to craft more and better items.
 

## Molecular Printing

In the City Center, you can find the Molecular 3D Printer, which will be used to print out gears from caches. It will appear when you are in Shangri La City Center. Clicking on it will bring you to the printing panel which lists all caches you have. It costs bitcoin to print, so make sure you have enough. All details including BTC cost and experience it will give will be listed on the cache printing panel.  

In the Molecular Printer screen, you can click on the cache you wish to print which will bring up a dialog if you have multiple items that are the same, asking how many you want to print. A good strategy here is to print all the trash items first, then the common, saving rare and legendary for the end. The reason for this is printing the more common and useless items first boosts your Printing Level, giving you a better chance to print more powerful gear with any Rare and Legendary caches you may have found.  

## The WeaponSmith

The Weaponsmith is a vendor in Shangri La City Center that allows you to sell items for BTC, and they often have items for purchase. When you are in the Weaponsmith screen, click over anything in your inventory and choose the Sell option. Alternately, you will see the items available for sale at the top. You can click on any of them and choose Buy if you can afford them. If you equip gears with **bargain** status you have a higher chance of getting a better deal. You can repair your items there too, since your equipments have their durabilities lowered the more you use them. It costs very little to repair them to mint condition, so be sure to repair them frequently.
