## Friends
To access your personal friends list, click on the floating menu and choose the 'people' icon. 
You can add friends by going into a user's profile, scrolling down and clicking 'Add to Friend List'. You can do the same to remove a friend by clicking the 'Remove From Friend List' button.
Adding someone to your friends list will not require the other person to accept the request. They will simply be added to your friends list.
Viewing your friends list will allow you to see if they are online, idle or offline.
