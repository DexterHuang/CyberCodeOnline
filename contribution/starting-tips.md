### Here are some starting tips:

#### Please take a look at the rules found under the 'Profile' tab, then under 'Tutorial' at the top.

* To begin with, take the Hyper Train Central Station [Adventure] to the level 1-4 area and attack the bad guys.
* Wait 'till your equipment level is at least 8 or so to start your first dungeon.
* Pay attention to your Gear Level. If your stats are too low for your actual level then it may be time to print some new gear.
* Items you print will always be the level of your Printing Rank.
* Print and scrap trash equipment (grey) to increase your Printing Rank.
* Read the Tutorial and FAQ to learn the game mechanics.
* The Tutorial can be found on the Profile tab at the bottom right of the screen.
* Good places to start reading in the Tutorial section are the Equipment, Combat, Dungeon and Profile pages.
* There is no Pay to Win. All purchases (Units or subscriptions) either affect everyone or are purely cosmetic.
* Lastly, you can always ask questions in the global chat and remember to check out our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JREx8xz)!
