>Today I finally got a new job that has to be done. You know, the usual stuff: Find the guy — Kill the guy. Ye, there was a part about this guy owing a dept that he should pay and if he does, let him live. But we both know they never do, so we can skip right to the problem solving bit.

>Problem here is the guy who owes money is actually one of the clerks in Medikama. They're known for their contrcats that don't allowthem to leave the work place at all. There's a high chance that I will need actually to kill this guy and then run away as fast as I can.

> Oh and note to self: After this job is done, never go back to Shangri-La ever again.
