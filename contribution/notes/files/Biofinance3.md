[A recording. Looks like a phone call intercepted by some amateur hacker]

*VOICE1*: I tell you, that chinese american guy is shady. There are no traces of him or his company. 

*VOICE2*: I'm told he used to work for the board of Cheng Holding. Some sort of "off the book" fixer.

*VOICE1*: He is not Ivy League management for sure. So where he comes from? Why is he giving orders to the lab director?

*VOICE2*: Baffles me. I have a bad feeling about this "injection of capital". I mean, why should any investment firm give money to Vitasyntech? We had no new products in years.

*VOICE1*: Nevertheless, he roams around as if he owns the place.

*VOICE2*: We'll see. We are living through interesting times.
