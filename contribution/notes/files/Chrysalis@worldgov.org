Nakamoto-sama,

Thank you for taking a personal interest in the neural backup initiative of the Cyber Code Project. The BT Civilization has made it abundantly clear how highly you value our research, and we're very grateful for your financial support.

I'm pleased to report that the latest round of testing utilizing a D-MAVID (Distributed Massive Array of Virtual Idle Disks) for neural backup via the Cybernetic Cerebral Enhancement implant is showing promise. In the latest test, 31.8% of subjects were successfully backed up and reimaged into new frames without issue. This success rate is nearly a 7% increase from the prior round of testing. At this rate, it's only a matter of time and
resources for us to perfect the neural backup process.

With that being said, our team lacks the expertise to effectively implement the D-MAVID botnet across the web for field testing. We humbly recommend seeking out assistance from someone with more experience in the requisite skill set for this upcoming phase.

We will continue updating you, and the rest of the board members, on our progress. If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Omnia mutantur,  

Chrysalis
