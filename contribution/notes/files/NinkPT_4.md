Okay. Why does everything goes wrong?! What happened to humanity? Why have they all gone insane suddenly? Even my friend! It's like they lost their minds. They just started killing each other with anything that they could find! Not like this isn't happening in the city, but this is something different!

Is... This because of those dog looking creatures? Don't say this happened because of them and the experiments that happened inside Medikama, Please! Because if it's true, I'll probably never escape this place. The of amount military presence is too much.
Also, I probably didn't got affected by this madness. Used of a lot of Pain Away Sprays recently. Not sure, actually, but I will continue to do that just in case.

And if you interested: I'm actually finished the job... But it's probably doesn't matter because I'm also killed the boss because he gone mad too.

Anyway, I need move out, there some gunshots nearby. I need to escape as fast as I can...
