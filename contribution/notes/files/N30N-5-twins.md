#### Tales from the Hangout

##### The Twins

_"It was a dark and stormy night.."_

Al' looked across at his twin - in truth, there was nobody he would rather mission with, but every now and then Beta just **totally** weirded him out.

The Ice twins were in the shadows on the top floor'ish-thing of the building skeleton that overlooked a south side warehouse, the Spud having asked them to provide _'tactical street oversight'_ (his words) for a delivery of meds he was expecting. PotatoMan had taken advantage of the recent batch of dud PainAway that hit the street to launch his own premium brand, little logo and everything. This was the first shipment and he was a little nervous.

Movement ... 

  _"Crate, east side"_  
  _"See it. Barrels 10 metres down"_  
  _"On it"_  
  _..._

A round ricocheted off the column above Al's head. _"10 o'clock, tenement roof"_ _"Go"_. Al' moved quickly, making sure he was silhouetted for a brief moment and Beta tagged the sniper.

Down at the warehouse it had basically degenerated into trench warfare. 

_"Street!"_

He sprinted along the ledge and leaped, deploying the matte black combat canopy almost immediately. The building was just barely high enough, leaving not very much margin for error. Kinda like life really. Beta touched down just behind him and they leap-frogged up the street to come up just behind the goons. 

After that, not much..

_"Go get that beer the 'tater now owes us?"_  
_"Yup, shaken not stirred"_ said Beta happily. Being all weird again.
