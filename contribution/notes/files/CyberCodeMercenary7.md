# Ideals of the Cyber Code Mercenary Group
> (part 7 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

The people who get chosen to be come a Cyber Code Mercenary are very diverse, there are no limitations of race, ethnicity, national origin, or even age. Cyber Code Mercenaries are chosen by the neural scan results that indicate the highest possible mental processing speed and resilience. Both are required for the brain to be compatible with the extreme acceleration rates used in the Military Grade Cortex Accelerators. Some of the Mercenaries are people who were randomly chosen by their aptitude, some are ex-elite military soldiers, some come from the Secret Service, and some are even ex-criminals. 

Those who have criminal records have a special AICORE installed that can detect any intent to do criminal activities, which will forcefully detach the consciousness of the host and send it to a virtual correctional facility. 

Despite the Cyber Code Mercenaries' differences, one thing unites them all: the obscene amounts of wealth they would amass from their bounty payouts and monthly salary.
