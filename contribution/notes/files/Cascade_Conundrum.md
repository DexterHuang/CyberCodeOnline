> ##Cascade Conundrum

There was a distortion in the air, crispness harsher than an impending lightning strike that preceded the event of dimensional forces themselves being torn asunder, sands of time bleeding outward like faint echoes.

The traces of this energy were only analyzed  after the fact, but some tremendous, radioactive mass (measured between  █████████ µSv and ████████████ µSv "roughly,") prior to the measurement device frying its heart away.  Since, there has been an observable ████████ µSv/h at the epicenter of this catastrophe.

The opportunity has not been missed by anyone with enough money or power. Within this catalyst point lies enough distilled power to keep our civilization comfortable until the end days. Every cynic here can see through their altruism, but really everyone is left with the same foreboding enigma. What caused this magnificent force to pierce through our world? How and why?!
