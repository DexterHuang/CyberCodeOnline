>Today I finally got a new job that has to be done. You know, the usual stuff: Find the guy â€” Kill the guy. Ye, there was a part about this guy owing a dept that he should pay and if he does, let him live. But we both know they never do, so we can skip right to the problem solving bit.
>  
>  
>Problem here is the guy who owes money is actually one of the clerks in Medikama. They're known for their contrcats that don't allowthem to leave the work place at all. There's a high chance that I will need actually to kill this guy and then run away as fast as I can.
>
> Oh and note to self: After this job is done, never go back to Shangri-La ever again.

>Did some scouting quickly and there's good and bad news. Good news is that there's few ways out of this building. Bad news is that I will have to use them. Turns out that this guy really works 24/7 inside of the building, ugh... Well, sucks to bea him.  
>  
>Also there are a few really strange things happening around this building. I really don't like those trucks parked near the building every morning. I mean, they don't have any markings and they're always 5-10 people with heavy weapons that guard them. Maybe I just have terrible timing on this job.

>Today is the day. In last 2 days I haven't seen any trucks. I think it's kinda safe to do my job now.  
>  
>I'm bringing a few friends that will help me to escape the building. You know them, we've worked together for two years already... Damn, how fast the time flew. Haha, got it? Flew? Drones? Ah, nevermind.  
>  
>I won't take any heavy guns - I can't go in with them anyway. Pistols and knives are actually allowed inside. Man, this city is insane.  
> Maybe I should take few grenades justto be sure that no one will follow us? I mean, I don't think they will even bother - this guy just a clerk, but still... Well, guess this is overkill. Let me make one last check on my mask and I'll go.. wish me luck.

>Okay. Why does everything goes wrong?! What happened to humanity? Why have they all gone insane suddenly? Even my friend! It's like they lost their minds. They just started killing each other with anything that they could find! Not like this isn't happening in the city, but this is something different!  
>  
>Is... This because of those dog looking creatures? Don't say this happened because of them and the experiments that happened inside Medikama, Please! Because if it's true, I'll probably never escape this place. The of amount military presence is too much.  
>Also, I probably didn't got affected by this madness. Used of a lot of Pain Away Sprays recently. Not sure, actually, but I will continue to do that just in case.  
>  
>And if you interested: I'm actually finished the job... But it's probably doesn't matter because I'm also killed the boss because he gone mad too.  
>  
>Anyway, I need move out, there some gunshots nearby. I need to escape as fast as I can...
