#### Tales from the Hangout

##### The Scruffy Kid's Lucky Day

A slap echoed down the alley..

  _"Gimme dose! Where'd ya get 'em anyway?"_  
 _"Traded for em, honest, I did"_ came the sniffled reply.

The goon made to move off down the darkened street, stopped a moment, thought, and
tossed a couple of bits of scrap back at the small figure hunched against the crate. 

  _"So did I"_ he rasped and walked away, tossing his newly acquired _'cubes_ from hand
  to hand.

The scruffy kid looked despondently at the rusty bits of scrap that weren't going to
be worth even a day old dumpster bagel. Just another hungry day in paradise. 

Hunched miserably in the corner a crate made against the wall, he was trying to find
the energy to  move, when a quiet scrape of cloth startled him into that hyper-alertness
that meant survival down here. Wondering just how bad the night was going to get - it
hadn't reached rock bottom yet, not for CC, not even nearly - he was staring 
apprehensively into the night when two dully luminous AI cubes silently arced out of 
the dark to land near his hand. Instinctively he reached out to grab and then just as
instinctively snatched his hand back, expecting the worst. But a quiet whisper out of
the darkness:

  _"Take them. They're yours"_

The kid looked around - there was a darker shadow against the wall. Maybe? From further
away down the street, a _'blam'_ echoed out of the darkness, followed by another and then silence. A invisible tension seemed to ease out of the shadow and another almost inaudible whisper:

  _"Sounds like your business associate ran into Worzel"_

As the shadow detached itself from the wall and started away the kid called out:

  _"Mister, wait.."_ and held out the two pieces of scrap.

A hand reached out to take them and the whisper again, this time with the ghost of
a smile:

  _"Seems like a good deal to me"_  
  _"Mister, what's a Worzel?"_

But there wasn't anything or anybody there to answer.
