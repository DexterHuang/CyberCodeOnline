#### Tales from the Hangout

##### Fettucini

Fettucini (only his mother ever called him Alfredo and even that was only back when
she still recognised him) was cheerfully trying to shake down the proprietor of _Hui's
Happy Noodles_ when he heard the door to the shop open.

Without even looking around he pointed his gun at the door and said _"Out!"_.

He was more than somewhat surprised to find his own gun being gently pointed at the ceiling while he was spun around to look into a level pair of grey-blue eyes, below a wild thatch of straw-coloured hair. It would have better better if they had been icy grey-blue eyes, but in the real world they were just level.

  _".38 special?"_ said a nondescript voice calmly. _"Bit retro isn't it? Now this .. "_, waving something a whole lot more complicated in the hand that wasn't occupied with Fett's pistol, _".. is an Alpha Thermal  Pistol of Precision, Legendary model. Palm recognition, dual 12 round mag's, LIDAR target acquisition and cybernetic sights. Hand loaded smart ammo of course, and it can put 6 rounds in a 5cm circle at 200 feet in 2 seconds"_.

Fettucini looked at the dude, baffled:

  _"Uh, sure dat's nice man, but what's it gotta do wit' me?"_  
  _"Oh, nothing much. Just thought you might find it interesting"_

Fettucini was not generally regarded as being the brightest candle on the cake but what he did next was so indescribably stupid that even he was not surprised to find himself sitting on the floor with his back against the counter, looking at the spreading stain on his chest.

  _".. cybersomethin' sights, hand-loaded .. "_ he thought, _".. good to know"_, before everything faded.

Hui pushed a brown bag of takeout across the counter:

  _"Your order Mr Worzel sir. No charge!"_
  
  _"Nonsense Hui, of course I'll pay for it! And sorry about the mess - this should cover it!"_, sliding two hash back across the counter.
  
  _"No worries, Mr Worzel sir. You have good evening, Mr Worzel sir"_
