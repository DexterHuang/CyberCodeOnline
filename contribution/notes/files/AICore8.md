# Coexisting With an AI in Your Brain
> (Part 8 of 8 aicore series)

First time users of AICORE may feel that the experience of having another different mind inside your brain feel very confusing and disorienting. When you activate an AICORE for the first time you will feel another presence in your mind with it's own set of thoughts and personality. Suddenly having a separate mind inside of you might feel odd at first, but after a short amount of time, your neurons will make new pathways after familiarizing with the new stimuli and heightened processing capability. Having an AICORE is a unique experience. Imagine having another individual that you can communicate  via telepathy, or put in another way AICORE is like an inner voice that you can converse with. Having an AICORE installed also means you can have it control your physical body partially or as a whole while you can observe, feel, learn and experience new skills form the AICORE or just sit back and relax while the AICORE handles things. When you let the AICORE control your body and your consciousness is not detached it is a unique feeling like your body is moved by an external force, some also describe the feeling as their body moving by itself. If you decide to detach your conciousness and do work or have fun in CyberSpace, whatever the AICORE experiences while you are away will be stored in your short term memory, which you can later recall after your consciousness returns to your body.
