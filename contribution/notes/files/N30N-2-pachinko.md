#### Tales from the Hangout

##### A Day In A Life In A Pachinko Parlour

The door to _Pete's Pachinko Palace_ jangled as she hip bumped through it, Rena looking
up from behind the counter.

  _"Hey, 's happening?"_    
  _"Not much, place is dead quiet, just the tall drink of water at the end. Might pick
  up a bit later though."_

She glanced down towards the end where the single customer was oblivious to anything
other than the bells and lights and flippers of the Palace's ancient and only pachinko table. Kinda cute though. Rena was laughing at her:

  _"Rule #1, do not do the clientele"_  
  _".. on the pachinko table."_ she chimed in with a grin. Rena picked up her stuff and
  swung out the door:  
  _"Outta here"_  
  _"Later"_

She made a latte, curled up on the stool still warm from Rena's butt and buried herself
in Anna's unnecessarily over-complicated entanglements, glancing down every so often to
check on their lone customer. Moscow, 1876 might be about as far from CC 2020 as
you could get but she was starting to think that really, except for the fur hats it wasn't that much different. The guy was actually pretty cute.

A cheerful whistle sounded from outside the door and she looked up as _cutie-at-the-end_
finished his game, picked up his jacket and headed out past her.

Best bright smile: _"Hey"_  
Startled half-smile back: _"Hey"_

Great. A whole conversation. From outside she heard:

_"Spud!"_  
_"Tripp"_

She half-listened as they moved away, rabbiting on about snails and crits and BTC rates.
Boy talk. 15 pages later she sighed and put the book down - it was becoming clear that
Anna was not going to jump Alexei any time soon - and wandered down to reset the machine.

Out of habit she glanced at the score list. `TRPLHLX` - dude was clearly a bit shy around vowels and girls - and then narrowed her eyes at the actual score. Vowels or no vowels, the guy must have the reflexes of a cat. _"Bet I could make him purr like one too"_ she giggled to herself.

She gave the machine a quick wipe and went back to snow falling in Moscow. Maybe he'd
be back. Maybe he wouldn't.
