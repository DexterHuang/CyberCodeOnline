# The Brain Computer Interface Perfected
> (Part 2 of 8 aicore series)

A brain–computer interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device. BCIs are often directed at researching, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions. Historically early BCIs were very limited in function, most often they can only read brain activity with no way to send input directly. Until a breakthrough was made in 2047, a full simulation of the human brain was finally completed, boosting progress to research on how the brain works. The first Cybernetic Cerebral Enhancement (CCE) prototype was made in 2050 by a researcher at Shangri-La BioTech. After rigorous safety testing and alot of controversy, finally by 2054 the first commercially was finally available. This marks the dawn of the era where our brains could communicate directly with digital devices. Now CCE implants are an inseparable part of us, current data suggests 94% of the human populace now has a CCE in their brain, the other 6% are mostly indigenous tribes and minority purist groups that are against having any sort of mechanical or cybernetic enchancements.
