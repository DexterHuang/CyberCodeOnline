_"Pst. Hey kid. Wanna get those ai cores of your hands?"_

...

A man who was oddly shaped like a potato beckoned me into doing business with him.
I was low on funds and didn't exactly know my way around so I felt like I had no
other choice.

We agree on a price of 1750 each. It was quite the sum for someone at my level so I
hastily accept. The transaction goes smoothly and I had what seemed like a fortune.
Little did I know this would bring me into a life of an underground business supplying
equipment for gang warfare. 

This single decision I made brought me into one of the first and most influential
gangs in CyberCode City. We became known as, N3ON C1RCUS.
