#### SirLemon: Random Musings

##### Intro

_"Pst. Hey kid. Wanna get those ai cores of your hands?"_  
...

A man who was oddly shaped like a potato beckoned me into doing business with him.
I was low on funds and didn't exactly know my way around so I felt like I had no
other choice.

We agree on a price of 1750 each. It was quite the sum for someone at my level so I
hastily accept. The transaction goes smoothly and I had what seemed like a fortune.
Little did I know this would bring me into a life of an underground business supplying
equipment for gang warfare. 

This single decision I made brought me into one of the first and most influential
gangs in CyberCode City. We became known as, N3ON C1RCUS.


##### Day 1 of CyberCode therapy.

_"Does the pain really ever go away? No matter how many times I use them I can never shake off all these emotions. It's like I'll never get over them. Never..."_

_"Sir, I'm more than willing to help you regarding your loss, however, taking medications that treat wounds won't help you cope as pain away doesn't have any effects in that regard."_

_"Oh. They should really put that on a label."_


#### Day 2 of CyberCode therapy.

_"Why are there so many billionaires around here, yet getting to 1 million is hard no matter how many I kill?"_

_"You did what now?"_


##### Day 3 of CyberCode therapy.

_"The sheer abundance of intellectual freedom that exists in with us in this day and age is truly astonishing. I mean, sometimes I wonder who the people who ask if they can redeem BTC for real-life bitcoins are and how they thought that it was possible to collect millions of dollars form a mobile game."_

_"Typically you come here and say some pretty weird s\*\*\*, but that's actually a good statement to build upon because I too question those people."_

_"Woah. Woah. Woah. Calm down with the character count. We only have so much space for a joke."_


##### Day 4 of CyberCode therapy.

_"Welcome back sir, wherever have you been? I haven't seen you in a while."_

_"Yeah sorry 'bout that. Been busy with business as usual."_

_"Understandable. Well, let's get right into it. What has been bothering you?"_

_"Honestly, I've thought too much in the past."_

_"We've all had our difficulties in life. What exactly about your past has been bothering you? And how does it make you feel?"_

_"Oh I don't have issues my MY past. I've just been thinking too much IN the past. As in past tense. Must have been all the memory chips I've picked up in dungeons that I keep shoving in my brain finally getting to me..."_
