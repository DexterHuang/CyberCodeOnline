# N30N C1RCUS

#### Worzel 'n WAP

It's hard to stay hidden on the streets of ShangriLa, I try my best stepping back into the darkness, that didn't work. 6ft above my head is the brightly lit sign of _N30N C1RCUS_. I figure I don't need to hide, I'm outside my headquarters and have plenty of backup. 

Lately the street is getting busy. Characters from all walks of life can be seen many of them I see day to to day going about their business, still I'm not to worried, many come many go some never to be seen again.

A particular set of fresh new faces catches my interest - I've been watching them for an hour or two now in and out of the weapon shop. It's hard not to notice them in their shiny new gear.  One wearing a yellow beanie hat, the other in a purple sombrero. I'm thinking what an odd look before seeing my own reflection thorough a window across the street.  I smile to myself thinking _"..who am I to judge? I'm as odd looking as they come"_. 

_"Who are they??"_ _"What is their agenda?"_ are just some of questions going through my mind. I decide to find out. 

I walk on down to the weapons shop - it looks like a mini-prison from the outside . All seems quiet. I step inside. Approaching the counter, the guy seems nervous as I quizz him on the new arrivals, before I can get a word in he says _"I have a message for you Mr Worzel"_. He slides a long nose bullet across the dusty counter. _"What's this?"_ I say back at him. The weapons dealer says _"It's inscribed, read it"_. I hold it to the light it and read _"You're not the only one doing the watching"_. With that he pulled down the counter shutter. 

Puzzled and now a little worried, I step outside. I'm alone, I need to get back. 

I head back up the street passing a dark alley.  I sense I am no longer alone. I hear the sound of clogs coming up behind me. I stop but don't look back, my heart racing as I hear the words: _"We are WAP! Sleep with one eye open"_. The sound of clogs disappearing back down the dark alley.  I move on, shamefully aware they got one over on me. At least i know who they are now but not in the way I had planned. Tonight I will sleep with one eye open.
