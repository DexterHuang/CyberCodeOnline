#### N30N C1RCUS: Princess9 Be Rappin'

    They say go to Shangri-La,  
    And I said nah, 
    Don't got no time for that.  
    But I did and I say what I saw:

    All my skills are at cap,  
    All I'm printing is ****.  
    It's back to the train, got baddies to maim  
    No time  
    To be using my brain.  
    
    I'm rolling in trash cache 
    Cuz I ain't got no hash cash.  
    
    And I know you're sayin' 
    That I should just keep on playin'.  
    I'm low level I know,  
    I started off slow but check out my gear,  
    I'm getting my flow.  
    It's all thanks to the C1RCUS, the N30N, the glow.
