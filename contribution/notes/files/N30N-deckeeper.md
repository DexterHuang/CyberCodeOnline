Once there was a.. - wait no. It doesn't seem right. Okay. Once upon a tim.. no it isn't this either. Okay, time.
Well how **do** you open up a story?

For me, it's this:

Just another story. No, once upon a time. Because once upon a time always has a happy ending. While mine doesn't. Why? Because a happy ending doesn't exist. I was once a fool to believe that I have my very own "Once upon a time" that would lead to a beautiful "Happy Ending". I was blinded. For a long time. Now let me show you what kind of
story this is.

Waking up is no longer the pleasure it was. There is a fleeting moment when I am whole again but it evaporates faster than summer rain off the burnt earth. I start my morning routine as usual. I get off the bed , and I slowly start packing up my armor and weapons. It's extremely quiet at this time of the day. You can see some
people start opening their shops but , mostly everyone is asleep. I grab my pain aways from the fridge and I start walking slowly outside my house towards the central station.

After a few minutes I reached the Central Hub. I love this city with every fibre of my existence, sure there are thieves in the crowds, but for every one of them there are a hundred angels in the rough. It is our basic human programming to be good, kind and loving, hard-coded into our DNA. Every hard-coded value can create glitches to our
dynamic universe, but those make our everyday interesting. They are the salt of the earth, the water in the rivers and the air we breathe. After my usual visit to Rossi at the Bank, to grab some antimatter charges from my vault, I slowly followed the road towards the Hyper Train Station.

The Train Station is filled with new faces every single day. Traveling by trains is very cheap and comfortable so the station is a place full of great hustle and bustle. Here you can come across people from different parts of the country in different fashions and colors. But i am not here to meet new people. I am just here to do my job. I quickly buy a ticket for the Flori Station and run towards the level 1 Alley to catch the next train.

The ride takes a couple of hours , but it's a great opportunity to prepare my weapons. Exploring those areas can be very dangerous, so it's good I am armed with some of the best items an explorer like me can carry.

Around this time of the year there are many more people that try their luck on exploring the Flori areas. Their hope is to find some hashes so that they can have better and more comfortable Christmas Holidays. But they are amateurs. Most of them will die from the first fight they will face while others will beg for help. But not me. My eyes are on a bigger price. After the arrival at the station I started following the path towards the Sprawling Flori Tower. Inside the Tower was guarded my beloved treasure, the last key part to finally create the Flori Key. But acquiring it is not an easy task, bounty hunters,burglars and crooks are guarding this place with their life.

I was walking alone when suddenly I heard a soft, calming voice.

_"Excuse me Sir. Do you know where I can find the Sprawling Flori Tower ?"_

I looked at his equipment. He had a few trash weapons and a common armor plate.This guy would die instantly in this area with those petty items.

_"This road over here will get you there. But you will have much better luck with your gear at the Parking Lot over there. Most burglars there are really weak and carry some good items for sale"_

He responded with a happy tone _"Thanks for your help !"_

He ignored my suggestions and started running on the path I was on. He is a dead man.

After a few minutes I reached my destination. To my surprise every enemy at the entrance of the tower was dead and the only thing you could see were some crates ready to get looted. After a small peak I started walking towards the upper floors. No enemies there either. I was shocked. Stacked corpses and open crates wherever I looked. Suddenly a harsh voice made me come back to reality.

_"YOU ARE DEAD FOOLISH KID!"_

I ran towards the last floor. When I arrived I saw the young man that asked me for directions ready to die from a MAD Bandit.I quickly reached for my Destructive Weapon and brought out an antimatter charge from my bag. With a precise shot I stunned the Bandit and with a quick shot from my trusted Primary Weapon I sent him to his never ending sleep. Then I quickly turned my eyes towards the Kid. He was seriously wounded from the many hits he had taken from all the guards in the Tower. I forced 2 pain aways down his throat.I waited a few minutes so that his body could recover a little bit and then I started looking through the crates for the key part. We couldn't stay there for a long time , more guards would show up. The key part was hidden in a really dark corner of the room. I shoved it deeply in my bag, I grabbed the kid and I started running back
to Flori Station.

My next actions are really vague in my memory. The last thing I remember is me and the kid hiding in a dirty sleeping room of a train. The Kid suddenly woke up and panicked.

_"Where are we ?"_
_"On a train."_
_"Where are we going?"_
_"To my hometown."_

He was in absolute shock. After a few seconds he started remembering me and what happened.

_"You.. You saved me."_
_"Yes I did."_
_"Thank you so much!"_

I didn't respond. Thankfully the train horn started making it's usual annoying noise. This means we were near the City Center. I started running towards the exit door and the Kid followed me. I tried to lose him in the crowd but he somehow managed to keep up with me.

_"Wait, I need to learn your name?"_, he started shouting.

I stopped. I reached in my bag and grabbed some rare caches and antimatter charge I found from the crates in the Flori Tower. When he reached next to me I handed them to him.

_"You will need them if you want to visit the Flori areas again. You can print those caches in the 3D printer  around the corner. I would suggest increasing your printing rank first in the Commercial Area though. You can use this map for directions."_

I once again tried to lose him in the crowd. His soft voice stopped me once again.

_"YOU DIDNâ€™T TELL ME YOUR NAME !"_

_"My name is Deckeeper. Welcome to Shangri-La !"_
