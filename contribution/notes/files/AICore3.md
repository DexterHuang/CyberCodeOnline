# The Invention of Cerebral Acceleration
> (Part 3 of 8 aicore series)

The first prototype for Cerebral Acceleration was invented in the year 2061 based on an obscure underground illegal Neuralink application BB2039.nrl. The BB2039 app or more known as BrainBurst was a secret application which allows a person to make time subjectively stop by temporarily accelerating brain activity by 1024 times through a Neuralink device. This application also doubles as a fighting game where a person fights for "Burst Points" that they can consume to use the Cerebral Acceleration Function. The application soon was deemed illegal after authorities discover its ability to directly alter the memory of the losing players to forget any associated memories regarding this application thus helping keep it's secrecy. After extensive research, development and regulatory hurdles, Cerebral Acceleration was finally approved for public use in 2068 allowing people to increase their brain processing speed and thought processes. This breakthrough in technology allowed research and academic progress exponentially. In daily use Cerebral Acceleration is mainly used as a learning aid allowing children to complete primary, secondary, and tertiary education as soon as 10 years old, with knowledge on par with the archaic Master's Degree. Cerebral Acceleration also has it's uses in the military and industrial sectors to increase concentration and reaction time, preventing work accidents and improving productivity.
