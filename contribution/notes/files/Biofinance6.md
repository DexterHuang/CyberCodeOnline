At all department heads at Intellico. Shangri-La plant. 

It is IMPERATIVE to notify logistic dept in advance when a large inbound shipment is coming in!

Today we received a 20 crates of an "experimental drug" (!) without warning. 

It has been temporarily stored in the offices' basement but whoever is responsible for this order must collect it IMMEDIATELY.

Failure to provide proper notification from now on will be reported to higher management.
