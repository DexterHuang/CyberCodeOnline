Years ago, during the golden age of
Shangri-La, the SLPD sought to create a
super soldiers capable of facing all
the horrors and enemies that threatened
humanity, decades of research were spent,
with technological advances and quantum
computing, better and better soldiers
were created, but with it, fewer
volunteers managed to survive these
horrific body modification processes,
in the year 2081, Vix Industries
managed to create the first perfect
super soldier, his level of modification
was so high, that his mind was partially
erased, leaving only a being closer
to a machine than he once was a
human, but despite this, a shred of
consciousness and fragmented memories
still wandered through the mechanical
mind of this soldier, who was called
Cronoh, during his service, Cronoh
fought on countless fronts, being an
extremely valuable resource for
Shangri-La, since he was the only one
of hundreds of thousands of patients
who survive the modification process.
But no lie lasts forever, over time,
Cronoh was discovering the truth that
lay behind him, at present, there were
so few volunteers to undergo these
modification processes, that the SLPD
began to resort to mass kidnappings,
in order to try to replicate what they
had achieved with Cronoh, discovering
the atrocities behind his creation,
and that they would never stop without
replicating another like him, Cronoh
finally stopped acting like a machine.
The 7/12/2102, the main facilities
of Vix Industries were totally destroyed
by a strange explosion that came from
within the facilities, all the advances
that led to the creation of Cronoh were
lost, and he was presumed dead after
find traces of his DNA among the remains.
Little is known about what really
happened that day, but since then, some
gangs and criminals from the underworld
secretly comment of a mysterious
traveler, who wanders through the most
distant and lonely underground tunnels,
hunting criminals and even law
enforcement, but helping those who
need it, some say that he is just
another rebel, but others tell legends
that if told on the surface, they would
assure you an eternity in prison.
