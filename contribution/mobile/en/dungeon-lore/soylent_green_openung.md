You found a degraded LCD monitor of notably old model is installed at a wall besides some abandoned vintage computer.  
It seems to play some sort of video but the quality is so poor, you can only see stripes flickering across the screen.  
You can hear muffled sounds emanating from rusty speakers nearby:  

> This conversation with Governor Hunt C. Santini and Scientist Yury Arias...  
> ... is brought to you by Soylent Red Bull and Soylent Yellow Cake...  
> ... high-energy vegetable concentrates...  
> ... and new, delicious Soylent Green...  
> ... the miracle food of high-energy plankton gathered from the oceans of the world.  
> Because of its enormous popularity,  Soylent Green is in short supply.  
> Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
