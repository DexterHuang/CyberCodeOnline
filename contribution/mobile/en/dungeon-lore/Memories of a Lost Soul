## Memories of a Lost Soul

You find a holo shard near a disfigured and torn apart body
Curious, you grab it and plug it in and thought:
-"It's a diary entry?"

> ... 3 years i've been in this gang. 3 long years.. They promised i would be seeing btc everywhere i went, IF i did what they asked... And ohh how i did everything they said.. 
> 
> Every. Single. Thing...
> 
> Cleaning toilets, robbing stores, sold drugs, stolen cars, walked everyones dogs, beat up people, kidnaped people.. even killed some... 
> 
> A lot of them didn't even look old enough to drink or smoke... 
Haven't seen a single coin..
Why would i think i would get rich by shooting a poor dog or a person... Why was i so stupid...

There's a moment of silence in the recording but you keep listening:

> ***Muffled Sobbing***

> I can't take this anymore... I need to run... I'm not going back
> there... It feels like I've been running for weeks now..  I don't know
> where to go.. They keep finding me.. 

A loud thump mixed with glass being broken and pipes falling brings your attention.
"Did he fell?"- you asked yourself. 

> ***Maniacal laughter and dogs snarling in the distance*** 
> 
> I think they found me.. OH PLEASE NO... AAAARRRRRHHhh
> 
> ***Static***


**//END OF RECORDING//**

You feel a sense of dread and returned the shard where you found it.
