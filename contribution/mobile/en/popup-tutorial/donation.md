# Donation

To provide the best No Pay-to-Win experience to you, it is necessary that all paid features are cosmetic such as profile images & chat frames,
or global buffs that benefit everyone in-game :)

## Why is profile picture donation-only?

Because CyberCode Online is a none-P2W game. so all paid feature must be cosmetic or benefiting everyone. custom profile picture is one of the optional cosmetic feature that does not give you any edge in the game. so it is important this is donation-only (we need money to feed the servers)
Hope you can understand the reasoning behind this :)

**Profile images are served as a token of thanks for the donators**

**Most the MMORPGs do not allow profile picture upload, even with a donation or their P2W system**

## Do I need to donate?

No. I strongly suggest you **Not** donate if you are not comfortable with it.

Donation does not provide any gameplay benefit; it is purely cosmetic.

So please don't donate unless you want to support the game!

## Do I need to donate for my whole life?

No, you can cancel the donation at any time easily via your store.

## The highest tier is so expensive, you greedy @$%#^#$!

The higher tiers are requested by kind players who would like to donate more.

Just like most other donation mechanisms, there is **No upper limit** on how much a person is allowed to donate.

(if you wish to donate more than is available in the app, you may message me directly 😃)

for example: Patreon/Buy Me a coffee and most other donation services for creators do not have an upper limit on how much a person can choose to donate,

but due to Google Play & Apple policies, I am not allowed to have links to external donation sites in the app,
so the only option for me was to have tiers for the common amount.
