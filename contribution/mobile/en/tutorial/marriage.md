## Marriage

Marriage allows two players to tie the knot and display their union with a custom banner visible on their profiles. Players can propose with wedding rings, customize their marriage display, and extend their union with anniversary gifts.

## How do I propose to another player?

1. Open the profile of the player you want to marry
2. Tap the **Marry** button
3. If you don't have a Wedding Ring, the game will show you purchase options to get one instantly
4. Confirm your proposal
5. Wait for the other player to accept to complete the marriage

## What do I need to get married?

- A **Wedding Ring** (available for purchase)
- Only one active marriage per player is allowed
- Proposals have a short cooldown period between attempts

## How do I customize my marriage display?

Access Marriage Settings by opening your own profile (when married) and tapping **Marriage Settings**:

**Marriage Symbol**: Choose from various hearts and romantic emojis to represent your union

**Background Image**: Upload a custom image for your marriage banner. Images are automatically moderated. Use an ultra-wide image (approximately 2:1 ratio) for best results. A default image is used if none is uploaded.

**Vow Phrase**: Write a personal message (up to 64 words) that follows game rules. Your partner receives a system mail notification when you update your vow.

**Symbol** You can choose various symbols to represent your union, and the symbol will be displayed on your marriage banner.

## How do marriage contracts work?

- All marriages have an **expiry date**
- You can extend your marriage anytime from Marriage Settings using an **Rose Bouquet**
- The game shows the requirement and your new expiry date before confirming
- Extensions stack, adding time on top of your remaining duration
- When you gift a bouquet, a global chat announcement celebrates your enduring love
- Expired marriages are automatically ended and anniversary data is deleted

## What happens if I don't extend my marriage?

If you don't extend your marriage, it will automatically end after the expiry date. The marriage is immediately removed for both players when the expiry date is reached.
If you are worried about forgetting to extend your marriage, you can extend it multiple times to ensure it has a long duration.

## How do I end a marriage?

Either partner can end the marriage at any time. The marriage is immediately removed for both players when divorce is initiated.
