# Calibration
![CalibrationStation](/resources/mobile-tutorial/CalibrationStation.png)

**Calibration** is an action where players upgrade their gear to a certain point of improvement, with the purpose of gear longevity and usability on a higher level later on. Calibrating a gear does not increase its level, yet it increases its base stats up to a certain tier of calibration.

It is advisable to start Calibrating your gear around level 50 (and above) as the lower level will outgrow the calibrated gear quickly making the calibrated gear useless on longer runs. It is also advisable to calibrate gear that's at least a Rare (up to Epic) rarity as higher rarity provides more calibration tier's to improve.

To do Calibration, A player needs to visit the Calibration Station that can be found in Shangri-La City Center (Map).

## Performing Calibration

Inside **Calibration Station**, the player will be asked to insert the **Equipment Calibration Core** to start the process. After inserting the core, the player needs to wait for 30 minutes before the Station allows the player to calibrate their gear (**This waiting process is not affected by any global buff / skips, including AFK Accelerators [Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter]**).

After 30 minutes, A player is allowed to calibrate any gear (excluding maxed Calibrated Gear) that's not equipped into their equipped slot. 

## Outside of Calibration Station

As of **v0.780 (2022/03/04) update**, players were allowed to do Calibration during the AFK Task / Dungeon session.

In order to do so, players must click on its designated gear then pick the `View Details` option. On the **Equipment Details** section, click on the **Upgrade** or **Calibration Slots** button to navigate to Calibration Station. In this way, players can do calibration at ease.

Keep in mind that only unequipped gear was the ones that can be calibrated.

## Chance of Destructive Failure

In process of calibrating the gear, there's a chance that the process will fail, resulting in a gear being destroyed. The percentage of failure is indicated by the red number on top of the selected gear in %.

It is advisable to remove the Upgrade Module that's attached to the gear before attempting to calibrate, as both gear and module will get destroyed in process of fail.

In general, the gear capacity / fail percentage of each tier is as follows:
| Gear Capacity | Tier | Chance to Fail |
|--|--|--|
| Trash | +1 | 2% |
| Trash | +2 | 5% |
| Trash | +3 | 10% |
| Common | +4 | 15% |
| High Quality | +5 | 50% |
| Rare | +6 | 100% |
| Legendary | +7 | 150% |
| Legendary | +8 | 200% |
| Epic | +9 | 400% |
| Epic | +10 | 666% |

## Override The Chance
Any +6 calibration and beyond is *impossible to achieve* without the use of **Calibration Boost**. They reduce the failure percentage and they stack / add with each other.

In general, the calibration boost tier (and where to find them) is as follows:
- **Calibration AI Shard (Common)** reduce the chance of failure by 5%; only for Personal Use; can be found in Rare Locked Containers
- **Calibration AI Shard (Rare)** reduce the chance of failure by 10%; Global Buff; can only be bought in the Arasaka Unit Exchange
- **Calibration AI Shard (Legendary)** reduce the chance of failure by 50%; Global Buff; can only be bought in the Arasaka Unit Exchange
- **Calibration AI Shard (Legendary)** reduce the chance of failure by 100%; Global Buff; can only be bought in the Arasaka Unit Exchange
- **Calibration AI Shard (Prestige)** reduce the chance of failure by 300%; Global Buff; can only be bought in the Arasaka Unit Exchange 

Players can also negate the destructive effect by activating **Calibration Safety Nano Bots** (which can be found in Mysterious Containers / or bought in the Arasaka Unit Exchange) before calibrating the gear.

Keep in mind that the boosts **will only last for 5 min** & each tier / rarity of boost **can only be stacked twice** (excluding Common Shard). It's best to be prepared before boosting.

##  Trade / Sell Calibrated Gear 
Players can't trade / sell their calibrated gear. To trade / sell related gear, players need to **Reset** the calibrated gear by using **Factory Reset Shard** (that can be found on Scavenge or Market).
