## What are Pets?

Pets are virtual companions that live in your apartment. They require regular attention to stay healthy and happy.

## How do I adopt a pet?

You need an **Apartment** and a **Sanctuary Adoption Pass** to adopt a pet.

1. Obtain a **Sanctuary Adoption Pass** by crafting it with Volunteer Service Medallions (earned from the Pet Shelter Volunteer Shift AFK action)
2. Visit **Neon Paws Sanctuary** (the Pet Shop NPC)
3. Activate the **Pet Adoption Buff** which allows all players to adopt during its duration
4. Tap **Adopt a new pet** while the buff is active

> **Note:** There is a cooldown period between adoptions.

## How many pets can I have?

The number of pets you can keep depends on your apartment type:

- Small Apartment: 1 pet
- Medium Apartment: 2 pets
- Large Apartment: 3 pets
- Penthouse: 4 pets

Pets exceeding your apartment capacity will be "living on the street" and cannot be interacted with until you upgrade your apartment.

## How do I take care of my pets?

Pets have four stats that need regular attention. Neglected pets will lose health and may die:

- **Hunger**: Feed using **ElectroFiber Bites**
- **Cleanliness**: Clean using **FurFlush Spray**
- **Happiness**: Play using **NanoNibble Ball**
- **Health**: Heal using **PawfectCure** when sick

Your pet will show status indicators like Hungry, Dirty, Unhappy, or Sick when they need care. Well-maintained pets (all stats healthy) will slowly regenerate health.

> **Tip:** Check on your pets daily to keep them healthy. Purchase all pet care items at Neon Paws Sanctuary.

## What happens if my pet's health reaches zero?

When a pet's health drops to zero, it becomes **Deceased**. You have a limited time to revive your pet:

1. Visit **Neon Paws Sanctuary**
2. Activate the **Pet Revive Buff**
3. Use the revive option on your deceased pet during the buff window

Deceased pets are automatically removed after a week if not revived.

## Can I customize my pet?

- **Rename**: Change your pet's name (4-16 characters, no spaces)
- **Reroll Appearance**: Get a new random appearance (Dog or Cat)

## Where can I find my pets?

Access your pets through your **Apartment** or the **Pet List** menu. Tap any pet to view stats and interact with it.
