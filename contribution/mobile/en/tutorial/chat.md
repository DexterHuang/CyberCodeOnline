# Chat

There are 3 types of chat rooms in CyberCode Online currently: 
- **Global & Language Channel** : Where everyone can chat freely and interact with each other. With newly added Language Channels, players can chat with their respective language in their dedicated channel. Chat rules still applies, even in different channels. There are also channels specifically for trading items with one another (Market and Auction) as well as a Roleplay chat.
- **Gang Chat** : Only the members of your gang can chat and see the messages sent in that channel. You can tag other people in the gang chat as well.
- **Private Messages (Mail)** : Where you can privately chat with other players. You will also receive notifications as in a form of Mail from the System after you sent items to someone or vice versa, when someone bought your listings on the Player Market or when you receive a Street Cred from someone.

In order to mention (or tag) someone in the Global chat, you can use '@' and the name of the user (for example: '@DexterHuang'). As you type their name, a list will appear and you can select the desired name from that list. The player mentioned by you will receive a notification that you mentioned them. 

Note: You can't mention (tag) someone in the private chat for obvious reasons, as it accounts as **Ghosting** and will annoy tagged player.
