## Chat

There are 3 types of chat rooms in CyberCode Online currently: 
- Global (or General Chat) - Where everyone can chat freely and interact with each other.
- Gang - Only the members of your gang can chat and see the messages sent in that channel. You can tag other people in the gang chat as well.
- Private Messages (Mail) - Where you can privately chat with people. You will also receive notifications as in a form of Mail from the System after you sent items to someone or vice versa, when someone bought your listings on the Player Market or when you receive a Street Cred from someone.

In order to mention (or tag) someone in the Global chat, you can use '@' and the name of the user. As you type their name, a list will appear and you can select the desired name from that list.

The player mentioned by you will receive a notification that you mentioned them. 

Note: You can't mention (tag) someone in the private chat for obvious reasons.
