#### Here at CCO, we hope to maintain a friendly community. In order for everyone to have fun and enjoy the game, please familiarise yourself with the rules. 

> If you see someone breaking rules or causing other conflicts in chat, please reach out to your moderation team. You can **report**, **report and block** the player or **tag a moderator** into the chat. We are here to help! Please do not escalate the situation by retaliating or further provoking if issues arise, our moderation team will take care of it. You can see who is in our moderator team on Profile / Map > Phone icon > Links > Credits. 

> If you have any issues with scamming, unfriendly chat on your PM/gang chat, or even if a mod isn't around, do not retaliate or provoke, take a screenshot and report it via direct messaging the moderators in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JREx8xz). 

### Important Guideline
* It is strongly recommended to play with only one account per person, as our system will flag alt accounts, preventing you from sending items between your accounts. *this can happen even if you only have one alt* (We will not help you move your items or unlock the account if the system flags you.)
* Never ever use in-game chat (including email) to send any kind of sensitive/personal information. Game chat is NOT encrypted and NOT secure. CCO does not bear any responsibility to protect your information you write in chat. Bear in mind that moderators have access to the chat log for moderation purposes. 

### Game Rules
* Cheating is not allowed. The use of bots, scripts, auto-clickers or any other things designed to automate or give you an advantage are prohibited
* Strictly no custom clients, API calls or internet packet with non-original game to game server. Such action is unfair for other players, and might be illegal to your local law. The game reserves all rights to take legal actions or report to local authority with electronic evidence such as IP addresses.
* Any malicious action/intent towards the game is strictly not allowed, we will permanently refuse to provide service to all malicious person and legal actions might be taken in the case of defamation. Examples of malicious actions can include but not limited to: 
   * insinuate others or take part in spreading false/fake rumor/news, in game chat, Discord server or store review
   * insinuate others or take part in using multiple accounts to spread meaningless messages, misinformation, complain, hate, rumor, spam or other messages in game chat, Discord server or store review
   * insinuate others or take part in actions that creates chaos or other negative effect to the game
* No excessive alts (**Unless you provide a reason to justify the necessity of creating an alt, it is deemed unnecessary, therefore excessive**) 
    * Example of valid reason:
      * You forgot the password of your main, and got locked out of account
      * Your main account has been bugged and becomes unplayable
    * Example of "cheating is not a valid reason":  
      * I want to create alts so I can trade faster then normal players
      * I want to create alts to store unlimited amount of items
      * I want to create alts so I can AFK with unlimited parallel tasks
      * I want to create alts so I can scam people with new names
* Don't exploit bugs, report them instead.
* Keep usernames family friendly.
* Advertising (global chat/discord/bio/gang motto) of Selling/Buying account/items for IRL money (both directly or indirectly) is not allowed.
* Using/advertising use of cosmetic gift as part of trade is not allowed, all cosmetic gift sent can only be unconditioned gift to friend
* Tagging people for fun or with no real purpose is not allowed. This is to prevent people from creating accounts just so they can tag them (doing so will also breach the "No excessive alts" rule).
* Any illegal activities will get you instantly banned -- including but not limited to -- harrassing underage person you met in game.

### Chat Rules
**All rules are listed here, there are NO "unwritten rules", but be respectful and stop if other players don't like what you are sending in chat**
#### Not Allowed:

**PLEASE NOTE: Please do not fight or agruge in game chat, and please use the appropriate channel for feedbacks and reports, as it will ensure that your voice is properly heard by the correct parties (global chat will be washed off in a few minutes, and the developer does not constantly watch the chat 24-7, therefore it would be a extremely ineffective way to deliver your feedback), and this is also to ensure that other player's right to a friendly and safe gaming enviroment is not distrubed**
