## Equipment

## Medical / Healing Items
Players can use **Medical Tech Parts** and **Tech Scrap** to craft medicine for use in dungeons. In order to craft better medicine, players need to improve their medical science levels which can be done by performing the associated job training or by crafting medicine. Furthermore, better medicine requires players to use more Medical Tech Parts. For example, the lowest level medicine that can be crafted is the Pain Away for 1 Medical Tech Part while the Degraded Nano Repair Bot needs 2 Medical Tech Parts and a medical science level of 10.  
  
There are two categories of medicine that can be crafted which are **Single Heals** and **Group Heals**. Further information as follows:

### Single Heals  
As the name suggests, single heals will only heal yourself for the specified amount. Single heal medicines are items such as Pain Away and anything ending with Bot (e.g. Nano Medic Bot). In order to craft single heals, you need the specified medical science level and Medical Tech Parts.  

In general, the healing item / heal amount / medical level requirement / med tech amount as follows:

> **Pain Away** (501+ Health) - No Level ; 1 Med Tech

> **Degraded Nano Repair Bot** (1201+ Health) - Med Science 10 ; 2 Med Tech

> **Degraded Nano Medic Bot** (6001+ Health) - Med Science 20 ; 4 Med Tech

> **Nano Medic Bot** (12001+ Health) - Med Science 30 ; 8 Med Tech

> **Military Nano Medic Bot** (26001+ Health) - Med Science 40 ; 16 Med Tech

> **Advanced Nano Medic Bot**  (54001+ Health) - Med Science 50 ; 32 Med Tech

> **Epic Nano Medic Bot** (1000001+ Health) - Med Science 130 ; 256 Med Tech

### Group Heals  
Group heals can heal the entire group in a dungeon when used but will heal each person less than single heals of the same tier. Group heals are items such as Pain Away Spray and anything ending with Drone (e.g. Nano Medic Drone). In order to craft group heals, you need the same level single heal and the associated number of Tech Scrap. For instance, to make Pain Away Spray you need 1 Pain Away and 1 Tech Scrap. 

In general, the healing item / heal amount / medical level requirement / healing item & tech scrap amount as follows:

> **Pain Away Spray** (301+ Health) - Med Science 10 ; 1 Pain Away & 1 Tech Scrap

> **Degraded Repair Drone** (901+ Health) - Med Science 20 ; 1 Degraded Nano Repair Bot & 1 Tech Scrap

> **Degraded Nano Medic Drone** (4001+ Health) - Med Science 30 ; 1 Degreaded Nano Medic Bot & 1 Tech Scrap

## Global Time Skips
Although these aren't items, players can also purchase global skips from their AFK screen (the Map tab when an AFK task is in progress). Skippers can choose from a range of 15 minutes to 180 minutes to skip. The time skips work with boosts, so it's more cost-efficient to use skips when boosts are already running.

As with all other paid items, time skips apply to everyone on the server. However, since they skip time immediately, only players who have started AFK tasks before the button is pressed will receive the benefit. Often it can be helpful to coordinate in global chat so player are ready to tag along.

The benefit is also applied to all AFK players one-by-one, so it may take 1 ~ 3 minutes for the effects to apply for everyone. Most regular skippers will recommend waiting around 1 minute after the skip button becomes available again, and purchasing 30-minute skips is the most popular choice when boosts are also running.
