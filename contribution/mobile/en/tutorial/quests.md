## Quests
Quests can be found in the Quest tab at the bottom of the screen. Here is where you are given specific tasks that will earn you extra Experience (EXP) points and Bitcoins (**you can get an additional EXP if you finish the quest when Frontal Cortex Enhancement [/ EXP Boost] were in-effects**). There are a variety of tasks available ranging from the Kill Enemies task to the Printing task. The quest itself is divided into two categories, as follows:

1. Normal Quest
Normal Quest consisted of single or individual tasks that were oriented around certain activities or dungeon delving. Once a quest was completed, players will be given another task immediately, as the task itself was random and monotone.

2. Dungeon Quest
Dungeon Quest can only be found by interacting with the '?' icon in Dungeon, these were referred to as **Quest Giver**. The quest itself consisted of one thing and one thing only: "give me [X] item, and you'll get [Y] item".

The reward for the quest itself ranged from Items to Perks. These perks (such as Overcharge, Reinforced, & Shield Enhance) are only usable in Nearby Enemies & Dungeons, and last only for a limited duration.
