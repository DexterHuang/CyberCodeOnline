## How to refer someone?
Simply give the person your in-game name, and when they create a new character, they simply need to select you as referrer at the character creation screen (where you name your character).

##  Referral Benefits
1. Whenever a player you referred purchases Units, you will also receive 10% of that amount, for example when a player you referred purchased 2000 Units, you would receive 200 Units automatically.
2. Whenever a player you referred reachs level `20`, you will receive the following rewards: 
	- 1 `Fanny Pack`
	- 1 `Locked Rare Container`
