Inventory management is crucial.
Level up a skill at the [COMMERCIAL AREA] when you have time to spare.
Mining is an absolute pain to level, as it needs quite a hefty sum of money and AFK time. Maybe hold off on it until you reach a point where you have an abundance of BTC/AI.
Need some extra space in your inventory? Equip gear or modules with the "pocket" modifier.
Only the first area (level 1-4 area) has no requirements when scavenging. As a complete beginner to the skill, you must start there and gain a few levels first.
Past level 140, no new crafting recipes are unlocked for Medical Science. Just move on to levelling other skills as you need not level it any further by means of AFK.

// Combat, Enemies, Allies
Are enemies taking too long to kill? Try increasing your critical chance and critical damage modifier.
Are you healing items healing for half of your max HP or less? Consider transitioning to the next tier of healing items.
Berserker Enemies do not have a tooltip for their buffs. Instead, you can only see it though a really high HP and Shield as well as in the name.
Consider swapping to better healing items when the current ones you're using heal less than 50% of your health.
Remember the CCO mantra: Hit, Heal, Hit.
Remember, CCO mantra is not "Hit, Hit, Die".
STUN and EVADE stack multiplicatively for a 52% chance to not get hit after attacking. (50.4% chance vs an AGILE enemy)
Take note of enemies described as Tough, Angry, Mad, Shielded, Marksman, or Berserker. They are tougher, but give better rewards!
Tough enemies deal more damage than normal enemies, so have your healing items at the ready.
Use only primary weapons to overpower street monsters to save ammo.
When you die, you'll lose some of your experience and 10% of your Bitcoins, so be careful!
You always attack first, so make good use of that advantage!
Your equipment marks decide your overall mark, dealing or getting dealt extra damage to certain factions of mobs. Try unequipping an item to change your mark and take less damage!

// Calibration Related
Calibrating gear makes it stronger, but calibrated gear cannot be gifted or sold.
Each level of calibration on gear adds more to the item than the last level, but is more likely to break the item as well.
Gear that has a 100% or more chance to break in calibration needs the percentage lowered by using a buff in the Arasaka Unit Exchange. This benefits not only you, but everyone else playing.

// Market Related
Always check the market prices before putting something up for sale!
Amadon is an equivalent of Window Shopping! Glaze your eyes onto Players Market while waiting for the AFK task to finish! (buying not included)
BARGAIN is both useful for buying at decreased prices and selling at increased prices at NPC shops. Note: Does not work on the player market.
CCO has a player driven economy, take care to ensure you're receiving the appropriate price for rare items such as epic caches. Many players will offer price checks freely in chat.
Check the player market often to get an idea on the value of your inventory, and if you should buy or sell your items!
Epic caches are incredibly rare, so consider saving until you're higher levels, or sell it to another player for a large profit
Inventory full? Sell your non-essential items in the player market or to your local trader in chat!
Low on BTC? Get some by cryptomining with Hash Processors at the [JOB HUB], or sell Hash Processors on the [MARKET].
Since you can't send BTC to players directly, AI Cores and other items replace BTC in direct trades with the gift function. Stock up when buying items from a trader directly.
