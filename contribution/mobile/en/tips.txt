How to level up faster? Stay away from chat.
In order to craft a key to unlock the next area, you need to travel to all 3 sub-areas and get the key in each dungeon boss room.
Is an area locked even though you unlocked it with a key? You may be underleveled.
Only the first area (level 1-4 area) has no requirements when scavenging. As a complete beginner to the skill, you must start there and gain a few levels first.
Mining is an absolute pain to level, as it needs quite a hefty sum of money and AFK time. Maybe hold off on it until you reach a point where you have an abundance of BTC/AI/Hashes.
When levelling mining below level 200, it is best to wait for a 100% BTC boost, 80% Synapse, and a Frontal Core to minimize BTC losses from hash mining and maximize XP gained in that short timespan.
Past level 140, no new crafting recipes are unlocked for Medical Science. Just move on to levelling other skills as you need not level it any further by means of AFK.
Ammo Crafting is not as useful early on as it is cost-inefficient, but later on it becomes more useful as more ammo is crafted, notably antimatter charges to start using destructive weapons consistently.
Sometimes it is best to strategically hold off from levelling printing level as to be able to make upgrade modules for your lowest level gear.
When using AI cores, XP and BTC gained is based on your gear score. Make sure to always update your gear with gear as close to your level as possible for more XP!
Did someone pop a frontal cortex enhancement? Use the extra xp to grind dungeons. A synaptic accelerator? Maybe do some AFK tasks at a faster speed.
Want to make money quick? With a synaptic accelerator up, scavenge for med tech and recycle at a gang recycler for tech scrap to sell. This also helps level scavenging up for better med tech rates.
What's the simplest way to level faster? Don't die. Consistency is better than speed. Take your time to avoid any deaths before you find a rhythm that works for you, and then work on speed.
Early on dungeons and AI farming are about equal in efficiency. AI farming is death free, not as hands-on, but consumes a lot of money. Decide if you would rather choose money or automation.
You CANNOT upgrade the level of gear once you have already printed it. That gear is going to stay the same level forever until scrapped, so don't go using high level caches willy-nilly.

Look out for special events like calibration boosts in Chat every now and then. You don't want to miss out on these!
Check the player market often to get an idea on the value of your inventory, and if you should buy or sell your items!
Gear that have at least 100% chance to break in calibration can be lowered using a global buff in the Unit Exchange. Alteratively, rare locked containers have a variation that only affects you.
Calibrating gear makes it stronger, but calibrated gear cannot be gifted or sold until it is factory reset, making it tradebale again but losing its calibration.
Each level of calibration on gear adds more to the item than the last level, but is more likely to break the item as well.

It is highly discouraged to spam in order to complete the chat quest. It only clogs up chat and might just get you muted, temporarily or permanently barring access for key functions like trading. 
Always be wary of people attempting to rip you off on your item by underpricing it. Remember to always check other offers first and choose the best one according to your own judgement and situation.
It is fine to talk about real world events in global, but keep in mind to respect people's opinions despite yours differing and to avoid vulgarity as CyberCodeOnline is an all ages community.
