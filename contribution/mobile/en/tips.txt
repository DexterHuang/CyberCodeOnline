// Experience, Leveling
"Trash" quality equipments are useful for getting tech scraps and printing exp.
After early game, Pain Aways become virtually useless to heal with, so feel free to recycle them for ~50% chance of a Medical Tech Part per Pain Away.
Ammo Crafting is not as useful early on as it is cost-inefficient, but later on it becomes more useful as more Ammo is crafted, notably antimatter charges to start using destructive weapons consistently.
Are your healing items healing for half of your max HP or less? Consider transitioning to the next tier of healing items.
Complete quests for a good amount of Bitcoin and exp.
Did someone pop a frontal cortex enhancement? Use the extra xp to grind dungeons.
Did someone pop a synaptic accelerator? Maybe do some AFK tasks at a faster speed.
Early on dungeons and AI farming are about equal in efficiency. AI farming is death free, not as hands-on, but consumes a lot of money. Decide if you would rather choose money or automation.
Enemies can hit hard, so make sure your guns hit harder.
Equipment cache comes in 6 rarities: Trash, Common, High Quality, Rare, Legendary, and Epic.
Gear and upgrades "of expansion" increase your inventory size!
Higher [SCAVENGE] skill allows you to scavenge in higher level areas and get more loot.
How to level up faster? Stay away from chat.
In order to craft a key to unlock the next area, you need to travel to all 3 sub-areas and get the key in each dungeon boss room.
Is an area locked even though you unlocked it with a key? You may be underleveled.
Level up a skill at the [COMMERCIAL AREA] when you have time to spare.
Mining is an absolute pain to level, as it needs quite a hefty sum of money and AFK time. Maybe hold off on it until you reach a point where you have an abundance of BTC/AI/Hashes.
Only the first area (level 1-4 area) has no requirements when scavenging. As a complete beginner to the skill, you must start there and gain a few levels first.
Past level 140, no new crafting recipes are unlocked for Medical Science. Just move on to levelling other skills as you need not level it any further by means of AFK.
Scrap your items to get Tech Scraps, then reverse engineer them to gain printing exp.
Sometimes it is best to strategically hold off from levelling printing level as to be able to make upgrade modules for your lowest level gear.
Study shows that mobs with the "Agile" tag grants more exp.
The gear you get from the [MOLECULAR PRINTER] is always based on your Printing level and not on your overall one, so make sure you always keep your printing level up.
Want to make money quick? With a synaptic accelerator up, scavenge for med tech and recycle at a gang recycler for tech scrap to sell. This also helps level scavenging up for better med tech rates.
What's the simplest way to level faster? Don't die. Consistency is better than speed. Take your time to avoid any deaths before you find a rhythm that works for you, and then work on speed.
When levelling mining below level 200, it is best to wait for a 100% BTC boost, 80% Synapse, and a Frontal Core to minimize BTC losses from hash mining and maximize XP gained in that short timespan.
When using AI cores, XP and BTC gained is based on your gear score. Make sure to always update your gear with gear as close to your level as possible for more XP!
You can only equip items equal to or below your level.
You can reverse engineer scraps at [JOB HUB] to gain printing exp.
Your crafting ranks cannot exceed your level; don't waste time doing crafting research when you're capped.

An unprepared dungeon explorer is a dead explorer.
Are you at Death's door in the middle of the treasure room? Ask for support in the chat and direct them to your dungeon!

Don't forget to craft healing items before diving into dungeon!
If you can survive one hit in a dungeon with at least 11% HP remaining, you can win by keeping yourself healed!
If you have a fully looted dungeon that you would like to leave, it is good etiquette to post an invite to chat before leaving, so that everyone can go and loot the dungeon.
In public dungeons, everyone can get the loot in the dungeon room as it is private. No need to worry about stealing loot!
No friends online to help with that dungeon quest? Try posting your Dungeon ID in the chat!
Not leveling as fast as you'd like? Try dungeon diving! (You get 2x more exp, 2.3x for gang dungeons)

You can enter dungeons already in progress to get quests and loot!
You can't enter a dungeon that is 13 levels above your level. It's for your own good.
You can't get any xp or loot from enemies 3 gear levels and dungeons 10 levels lower than you.


// Calibration Related
Calibrating gear makes it stronger, but calibrated gear cannot be gifted or sold until it is factory reset, making it tradebale again but losing its calibration.
Each level of calibration on gear adds more to the item than the last level, but is more likely to break the item as well.
Gear that have at least 100% chance to break in calibration can be lowered using a global buff in the Unit Exchange. Alteratively, rare locked containers have a variation that only affects you.
Look out for special events like calibration boosts in Chat every now and then. You don't want to miss out on these!


// Combat, Enemies, Allies
Are enemies taking too long to kill? Try increasing your critical chance and critical damage modifier.
Are you healing items healing for half of your max HP or less? Consider transitioning to the next tier of healing items.
Berserker Enemies do not have a tooltip for their buffs. Instead, you can only see it though a really high HP and Shield as well as in the name.
Consider swapping to better healing items when the current ones you're using heal less than 50% of your health.
Craft or buy Pain Away to be able to recover health between fights in dungeons.
HP goes back to full after each battle, unless you're in a dungeon!
If you can survive one hit in a dungeon with at least 11% of your HP left, you can win by keeping yourself healed!
Remember the CCO mantra: Hit, Heal, Hit.
Remember, CCO mantra is not "Hit, Hit, Die".
STUN and EVADE stack multiplicatively for a 52% chance to not get hit after attacking. (50.4% chance vs an AGILE enemy)
Shields regenerate after you defeat an enemy in the dungeon.
Take note of enemies described as Tough, Angry, Mad, Agile, Shielded, Marksman, or Berserker. They are tougher, but give better rewards!
There's a maximum of 4 enemies in a non-boss dungeon room.
Tough enemies deal more damage than normal enemies, so have your healing items at the ready.
Use only primary weapons to overpower street monsters to save ammo.
When you die, you'll lose 10% of the total experience to go to the next level and 10% of your Bitcoins on hand, so be careful! 
You always attack first, so make good use of that advantage!
You will always recover to full health while not in a dungeon.
Your equipment marks decide your overall mark, dealing or getting dealt extra damage to certain factions of mobs. Try unequipping an item to change your mark and take less damage!


// Market Related

Amadon is an equivalent of Window Shopping! Glaze your eyes onto Players Market while waiting for the AFK task to finish! (buying not included)

Epic drops are incredibly rare and are announced globally. Expect many players to private message you to buy an epic if you get one.
