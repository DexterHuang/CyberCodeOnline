You can sell your items in the [PLAYER MARKET].
Your inventory has a storage limit; keep an eye on it or you will lose loot.
Dungeons are a great source of AI Cores and Hash Processors.
SCAVENGE to find components for crafting ammo and medicine.
Unequip upgrade modules when switching equipped gear to make them available for the new gear.
Gear and upgrades "of expansion" increase your inventory size!
Healing items such as Pain Away Spray heal your teammates as well!
BTC (bitcoin) in this game isn't redeemable; it's just in-game currency. :'(
Don't forget to send a thank you to @DexterHuang in chat for making this game!
You can store excess upgrade modules in High-Quality equipment to save inventory space.
Dying a lot? Level up your PRINTING RANK to your player level, then print new equipment!
Confused about the equipment cache you just found? Go to the [MOLECULAR 3D PRINTER] and make some gear.
Equipment caches come in 6 rarities: Trash, Common, High Quality, Rare, Legendary, and Epic.
Did you know you can access the mobile version of the game from your computer? Go to cybercodeonline.com and shrink the browser window!
Always carry medical parts and ammo parts on you while in a dungeon.
Epic caches are extremely rare. Consider yourself lucky if you get one.
Low on BTC? Get some by cryptomining with Hash Processors at the [JOB HUB], or sell Hash Processors on the [MARKET].
Higher SCAVENGE skill allows you to scavenge in higher level areas and get more loot.
Have you looked at your inventory or thought to do any crafting yet? Because you should!
Secret Key Fragments appear in both normal and challenge dungeons.
If you are reading this while driving, PUT THE PHONE DOWN!
Don't chat and drive!
While Antimatter Charges aren't exactly rare, they aren't easy to come by either. One shouldn't use them in every single encounter.
Game broken? Refresh or restart app.
AFK never ending? Refresh or restart app.
Tried refreshing or restarting the app?
Always check the market prices before putting something up for sale!
You need a lot of Tech Scraps to open a locked container.
Scrap your unused items to get Tech Scraps; you will need them to open locked containers.
Ask your friendly neighbor for prices of assorted items!
After early game, Pain Aways become virtually useless to heal with, so feel free to recycle them for ~50% chance of a Medical Tech Part per Pain Away.
If you can't afford to print a certain quality of equipment cache, try checking out the [PLAYER MARKET] first and seek cheaper alternatives. You might find affordable items for your level.
Inventory management is crucial.
You can switch equipment during a dungeon.
You can craft healing items mid-dungeon to restock.
Each mod can add up to 5% critical chance bonus.
You can obtain a steady source of Ai Cores and Hash Processors by defeating the boss in a challenge difficulty dungeon.
Need some extra space in your inventory? Equip gear or modules with the "pocket" modifier.
Remember to max out your PRINTING RANK before printing your equipment.
Did you find a locked container? You can open it in [TERMINAL], but you'll need some Tech Scrap and BTC.
If you feel your inventory is constantly full, now might be a good time to consider that new backpack upgrade.
Want to be more efficient at dungeons after doing them for quite some time? Take a break.
You can machine craft more Tech Scraps at the [GANG] via Automatic Recycler.
If you need BTC, try selling unwanted items to the Weaponsmith. The "Bargaining" stat helps with this.
Inventory getting full? Lost BTC when you flatlined? Store items or BTC in the [BANK OF ARASAKA].
POCKETs are increasingly helpful the longer you play as you get more and more items clogging your inventory. Either do a cleanup of those items, or invest in a better backpack when necessary.

// Experience, Leveling
Scrap your items to get Tech Scraps, then reverse engineer them to gain printing exp.
Your crafting ranks cannot exceed your level; don't waste time doing crafting research when you're capped.
You can reverse engineer scraps at [JOB HUB] to gain printing exp.
"Trash" quality equipment is useful for getting tech scraps and printing exp.
Level up a skill at the [COMMERCIAL AREA] when you have time to spare.
Studies show that mobs with the "Agile" tag grant more exp.
Not levelling as fast as you'd like? Try dungeon diving! (You get 2x more exp, 2.3x for gang dungeons)
The gear you get from the [MOLECULAR PRINTER] is always based on your Printing level (not your player level), so make sure you always keep your printing level up.
To keep the game fresh, it's impossible to gain EXP and loot from enemies 3 gear levels or dungeons 10 levels below you.
Fight enemies and dungeons above your level for more juicy exp.
Wait until someone uses the 180% exp buff to redeem dungeon quest rewards to gain greater experience.
Doing challenge dungeons with other players is the fastest way to gain levels while having fun!
Complete quests for a good amount of BTC, EXP, and even items!
How to level up faster? Stay away from chat.
In order to craft a key to unlock the next area, you need to travel to all 3 sub-areas and get the key in each dungeon boss room.
Is an area locked even though you unlocked it with a key? You may be underleveled.
SCAVENGING or doing afk tasks at [COMMERCIAL AREA] has little impact on your inventory space.
When your level is high, you might notice that quests are no longer impactful to your BTC balance. You can still do them for fun.
Printing high quality caches is significantly more expensive than printing common and trash caches.
Only the first area (level 1-4 area) has no requirements when scavenging. As a complete beginner to the skill, you must start there and gain a few levels first.
Mining is an absolute pain to level, as it needs quite a hefty sum of money and AFK time. Maybe hold off on it until you reach a point where you have an abundance of BTC/AI/Hashes.
When levelling mining below level 200, it is best to wait for a 100% Transaction Exploit, 80% Synapse Acceleration, and a Frontal Cortex Enhancement to minimize BTC losses and maximize XP gained.
Past level 140, no new crafting recipes are unlocked for Medical Science. Just move on to levelling other skills as you need not level it any further by means of AFK.
Ammo Crafting is not as useful early on as it is cost-inefficient, but later on it becomes more useful as more ammo is crafted, notably antimatter charges to start using destructive weapons consistently.
Sometimes it is best to strategically hold off from levelling your printing level, so that you can make upgrade modules for your lowest level gear.
When using AI cores, XP and BTC gained is based on your gear score. Make sure to always update your gear with gear as close to your level as possible for more XP!
Did someone pop a frontal cortex enhancement? Use the extra xp to grind dungeons. A synaptic accelerator? Maybe do some AFK tasks at a faster speed.
Want to make money quick? With a synaptic accelerator up, scavenge for med tech and recycle at a gang recycler for tech scrap to sell. This also helps level scavenging up for better med tech rates.
What's the simplest way to level faster? Don't die. Consistency is better than speed. Take your time to avoid any deaths before you find a rhythm that works for you, and then work on speed.
Early on, dungeons and AI farming are about equal in efficiency. AI farming is death free, not as hands-on, but consumes a lot of money. Decide if you would rather choose money or automation.
You CANNOT upgrade the level of gear once you have already printed it. That gear is going to stay the same level forever until scrapped, so don't go using high level caches willy-nilly.
You can use AI cores in locations with much higher level than you. Collect keys from dungeons to unlock them early.

// Social, Chat, UI, Systems

In the chat terminal, type @ to mention another player.
Don't forget to send a thank you to @DexterHuang in chat for making this game.
There's a tutorial under the 'Profile' tab.
You can access the mobile version of the game from your computer by going to cybercodeonline.com and shrinking the browser window!
We also have a desktop version of this game at cybercodeonline.com!

Begging for Global Time Skips is generally frowned upon by the community.
If your game is frozen or you can't move in a dungeon, try closing and reopening the game.
Game broken? Refresh or reload.
AFK never ending? Refresh or reload the game.
Tried refreshing or reloading the game?
Feel free to share unwanted gear to players of the correct level with worse gear.
Be nice to other players. :)
Inventory full? Sell your non-essential items in the player market or to your local trader in chat!
Being in a gang has the perks of accessing a few new AFK tasks, as well as the gang dungeon. Plus, playing with others just makes the game much better!
Want to be in a gang? You will have to be invited by someone. There is no application button.
If you have a fully looted dungeon that you would like to leave, it is good etiquette to post an invite to chat before leaving, so that everyone can go and loot the dungeon.
Epic caches cost an arm and a leg. If you are lucky enough to get one at a low level, try selling them though an auction in chat to boost your balance by a significant amount!
Since you can't send BTC to players directly, AI Cores and other items replace BTC in direct trades with the gift function. Stock up when buying items from a trader directly.
Look out for special events like calibration "trains" in Chat every now and then. You don't want to miss out on these!
Check the player market often to get an idea on the value of your inventory, and if you should buy or sell your items!
Gear that has a 100% or higher chance to break in calibration can be lowered by using a global buff in the Arasaka Unit Exchange. Alteratively, rare locked containers have a variation that only affects you.
Calibrating gear makes it stronger, but calibrated gear cannot be gifted or sold until you use a [Factory Reset Shard] on it.
Each level of calibration on gear adds more to the item than the last level, but is more likely to break the item as well.
You can use AI cores in locations with much higher level than you. Collect keys from dungeons to unlock them early.
Amadon is an equivalent of Window Shopping! Glaze your eyes onto Players Market while waiting for the AFK task to finish! (buying not included)
It is highly discouraged to spam in order to complete the chat quest. It only clogs up chat and might just get you muted, temporarily or permanently barring access for key functions like trading. 
Always be wary of people attempting to rip you off on your item by underpricing it. Remember to always check other offers first and choose the best one according to your own judgement and situation.
It's fine to talk about real world events in global, but keep in mind to respect everyone's opinions and to avoid vulgarity as CyberCodeOnline is an all-ages community.

// Equipment attributes
BARGAIN does not affect price in player-run stalls.
Some attributes are exclusive to certain kinds of equipment, for example, weapons have no EVADE.
Total STUN caps at only 20%. Some attributes have much higher ceiling, such as Crit Damage.
REGEN and ESCAPE do nothing in nearby enemies battles.
Equipement with higher quality does not mean its attribute is better, but its primary stat is usually better.
BARGAIN equipment are not worth more when sold, instead, when you wear BARGAIN equipment, anything you sell to NPC will worth more.
STUN and EVADE stack multiplicatively for a 52% chance to not get hit after attacking. (50.4% chance vs an AGILE enemy)
CRIT CHANCE and CRIT DAMAGE are sought-after modules as they help speed up the time to complete a dungeon by increasing your DPS.
CRIT DAMAGE's 200% cap applies to the BONUS CRIT DAMAGE and not the base CRIT DAMAGE for a total of 220% when fully capped.

// Combat, Enemies, Allies
Your health goes back to full after each battle, unless you're in a dungeon!
You always attack first, so make good use of that advantage!
Shields regenerate after you defeat an enemy in a dungeon.
Craft or buy Pain Away to be able to recover health between fights in dungeons.
Take note of enemies described as Tough, Angry, Mad, Agile, Shielded, Marksman, or Berserker. They are tougher, but give better rewards!
Secret keys are needed to access higher level stations; search dungeons for their fragments!
Remember the CCO mantra: Hit, Heal, Hit.
Challenge dungeons always have a tough boss, so don't forget to take your friends with you when venturing into one of them.
When you die, you'll lose 10% of the total experience to go to the next level and 10% of your held BTC, so be careful!
If you die with under 10% of the progress to the next level, you will go down a level. Be careful to not die!
Use primary weapons to overpower street monsters and save ammo.
You can't enter a dungeon that is 13 levels above your level. It's for your own good.
If you can survive one hit in a dungeon with at least 11% of your HP left, you can win by keeping yourself healed!
Are you at Death's door in the middle of the treasure room? Ask for support in the chat and direct them to your dungeon!
Are enemies taking too long to kill? Try increasing your critical chance and critical damage modifier.
You can enter dungeons already in progress to get quests and loot!
Consider swapping to better healing items when the current ones you're using heal less than 50% of your health.
Don't forget to craft healing items before diving into dungeon!
Tough enemies deal more damage than normal enemies, so have your healing items at the ready.
There's a maximum of 4 enemies in a non-boss dungeon room.
Boss rooms in challenge and gang dungeons have a guaranteed locked container, as well as a boss that drops massive loot and a capacity of 6 enemies.
While challenge dungeons are harder than normal ones, the boss in challenge dungeons give a ludicrous amount of experience and loot.
Want to make sure everyone gets loot in a public dungeon? Make sure everyone deals at least 20% of the mob's max HP as damage.
In public dungeons, everyone can get the loot. No need to worry about any of it being stolen!
If you are annoyed by kill-stealing, it's time to try adding a password to your dungeons.
Angry and Mad enemies are quicker to kill than Tough, Marksman, Agile or Shielded enemies.
You can join a dungeon without fighting anything. Use it to your advantage, including completing quests or taking keys.
DO NOT push your luck if you feel your health is just enough to take another hit.
If you pressed attack and the game lags, DO NOT SPAM ATTACK! Wait, refresh or restart the game.
If you apparently clicked on an enemy but it shows "Nothing is found", DON'T CLICK "Go back", you should refresh the game.
Berserker Enemies do not have a tooltip for their buffs. Instead, you can only see it though a really high HP and Shield as well as in the name.
Preparing a burst of dungeon grinding? Try saving up quests which give buffs and use them all at once to do dungeons faster and consume less medicine.

There is no pay to win aspect in CyberCodeOnline. Items bought through the Arasaka Unit Exchange benefit everyone, and the Cosmetic Cyberwear is purely cosmetic.
Want to stop making the same mistakes as a beginner? Play more.
Want to be more efficient at doing dungeons after doing it for quite some time? Stop doing them and get some rest.
Cosmetic Cyberwear all cost a recurring amount of real world money, with the exception of Prestige which is a purchase that will stay on your account for a lifetime.
How can you get units aside from paying? Simple, you can't. Units are a currency that will always cost real world money, but everything purchasable with it is a global effect or cosmetic.
