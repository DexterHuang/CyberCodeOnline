## 装備
装備のレベルが現在のプレイヤーレベル以下であれば装備可能です。  
全ての装備は以下レアリティのどれかとなります:

  - ゴミ (灰色)
  - 一般 (白色)
  - 高品質 (緑色)
  - レア (黄色)
  - 伝説 (赤紫色、濃いピンク色)
  - 英雄 (えんじ色)

装備によっては、高いレアリティのものは良い性能と多くのアップグレードモジュールスロットがあります。  

🔹 初心者は、ゴミレアリティの製作と装備が重要になります。プリントにかかる費用が最も安いためです。  
🔹 レベル5～10では、一般品質のキャッシュのプリントができるようになっていきます。  
🔹 レベル10～20では、あなたは十分なBTCを持っているため、高品質レアリティの装備を使い始めるでしょう。  
🔹 レベル20～40,50では、レア品質の装備をプリントし、装備できるようになっていきます。  
🔹 またレベル40～50では、伝説品質の装備をプリントし、装備できるようになっていきます。  
🔹 レベル90～100以上では、もしあなたがこれまで入手または購入する機会があったのなら、ゲーム内で最も高価で貴重な英雄品質の装備をプリントして装備できます。  

これらは、あなたが各品質の装備をどのように扱うべきかを決めているのではなく、各レベル帯でどの品質の装備を扱った方がよいかを推奨するものです。


## Finding Equipment

You can find equipment and equipment caches in the dungeons or when fighting individual enemies (street fights).  

Once you are level 5, you will be able to use the Player Market to purchase different types of equipment, crafting materials and other items.

## Printing Equipment

Caches can be used to print equipment at your current Printing Rank at the Molecular 3D Printer in the City Center.  

The level of the printed gear will be the same as your Printing Rank, so make sure to keep your Printing Rank at the same level as your player level.  

## Upgrade Modules

You can install upgrade modules in your equipment. In order to equip the module, it's level cannot be higher than the equipment's level.  
E.g.: you cannot install a level 20 upgrade module in level 5 gloves.  

Upgrade modules can be removed at any time.  
Removed upgrade modules will take space in your inventory so pay attention to that.  
Make sure you have enough space in your inventory before removing any upgrades.  

If your inventory is getting cluttered with upgrade modules you can't bear to get rid of, remember you can store unused modules in any unused equipment in your inventory. 
Level rules still apply, and remember to remove them before getting rid of the equipment. 

Scrapping a piece of equipment that have an upgrade module installed in it, will also delete the said module!  
You will not recover it!
