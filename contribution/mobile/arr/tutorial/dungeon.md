## Dungeons

## Types of Dungeons
  
![DungeonTypes](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonTypes.png)
  
These are the three types o' dungeons that ye be able t' enter. Th' [normal] dungeon will include a key fragment in the booty cabin 'n no boss. Th' [challenge] dungeon be a lot harder but includes more crates fer loot 'n has a boss in the loot cabin that gives a lot o' EXP.  Th' [gan'] dungeon be the hardest o' all 'n requires that ye be in a gang 'n 'ave a Gang Invasion Order Transmitter.  Enemies are 4-5x stronger than normal dungeons but has greater rewards.

## Creating / Joining a Dungeon
  
When creatin' a dungeon, select the dungeon ye wants t' create. Ye can name it 'n choose t' make it Public or Private. Ye can also protect the dungeon wit' a password.

Public Dungeons are available t' everyone t' see 'n join (if they meet the level requirements) by accessin' the list o' dungeons.

Password protected dungeons can be seen by oth'r players but they can nah join unless they know th' password. 'tis useful if ye wants t' clear a dungeon wit' specific scallywags. Share th' password in Gang chat or through Mail.

If ye'd rather join an existin' dungeon, ye can press th' floatin' menu button at th' bottom right, then select th' buildings icon t' view a list o' open dungeons, as shown above in th' screenshots.

At th' top right o' each dungeon panel, ye can find th' dungeon level. Each panel includes a list o' players 'n th'ir status in th' dungeon. At th' bottom, ye can see how many enemies are left. Ye can choose t' join a fresher dungeon t' gain more EXP or enter empty dungeons t' claim loot.

As shown in th' images above, thar are several players in th' same dungeon. Th' rules are th' same regardless o' how many players are in a dungeon; th' only difference be that players can help each other out. When usin' heals, 'tis usually advised t' use th' AOE items (such as Pain Away Spray) t' heal both yourself 'n yer co-op partners. Ye can see everyone's health bars above th' player icons.

When an enemy be scuttled wit' th' help from a matey, everyone who dealt 20% or more damage be given EXP 'n a chance fer a reward, as long as thar level ain't too high fer th' mob. All crates 'n loot are unique t' each player, so ye don't needs t' worry about sharin' loot or havin' yers pilfered. Grab everythin' ye wants 'n discard th' rest!

In this image, at th' bottom under th' '[WEIGH ANCHOR]' button, ye will find a button labeled '[Send in'ite t' global chat]'. 'Tis will send an invite t' th' global chat so oth'rs can join easily by jabbin' on th' message. Anyone around yer level can join 'n help ye out as long as they be within 10 levels below or 12 levels above yer dungeon.

Ye can also jab on messages from other players t' join tharr dungeon.

Aft a player dies or leaves, te'y can nah rejoin th' dungeon.
  
## Entrance and Icons
  
![DungeonEntranceUsed](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonEntranceUsed.png)
  
Here ye can see th' first cabin o' a dungeon. There are doors which will take ye t' another cabin in th' dungeon. Ye can find these doors on all sides o' th' dungeon rooms.  Ye can nah enter a new cabin 'til ye 'ave scuttled all enemies in th' current cabin.

This also shows an example o' a cabin that has been completed. Note th' greyed out crates, indicatin' that th'y 'ave been looted already. Th' door on th' right wall be also greyed out, which means ye 'ave already been through it. 'tis essential t' nah get lost while explorin' th' dungeon.

### Enemies
  
![DungeonEnemies](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonEnemies.png)
  
Thar are four alien lookin' icons spread across th' cabin, 'n these are th' enemies ye 'ave t' defeat afore proceedin' t' th' next cabin or accessin' th' crates in th' cabin. Skewer on one o' them t' fight 'em.
  
![DungeonFight](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonFight.png)
  
Rules are slightly different in th' dungeons when ye fight enemies. Ye will 'ave a row o' 3 buttons above yer attack options which ye can assign t' usable items from yer booty. Ye shall assign medical items t' this hotbar since yer health doesn't regenerate automatically aft each fight.

Ye also 'ave an 'Escape' button on th' top left. Th' success rate o' ye escapin' be based on yer player 'escape' stat.  
 
### Good Guy (?)
  
![DungeonGoodguy](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonGoodguy.png)
  
Here, ye can see th' '?' icon, indicatin' a quest if ye choose t' accept it. Ye can find one quest giver per dungeon, 'n they are usually placed randomly in one o' th' rooms.
  
![DungeonGoodguy2](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonGoodguy2.png)
  
Here be an example o' th' dialogue that pops up aft jabbin' on th' '?'. They will ask fer items in return fer other items or power-ups. 'tis up t' ye t' decide if th' trade be worthwhile; howe'er, if ye can afford it, 'tis usually worth acceptin' fer th' extra EXP ye gain from completin' it. Some o' th' text on this screen be randomly generated from a file, so ye may get odd or funny references, if it makes any sense at all.

### Lore (!)

![DungeonLoreguy](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonLoreguy.png)

There are exclamation marks dotted around dungeons that provide snippets o' game lore. These don't 'ave an impact on yer game or th' dungeon but may be interestin' t' read.

### Treasure / Boss Room
  
![DungeonBossTreasureCoop](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonBossTreasureCoop.png)
  
This cabin be special, as ye can tell from th' increased number o' crates. Th' crate that looks like a window contains a key fragment that can be used fer craftin' Secret Keys that unlock new areas.

In this screenshot, ye can also see other players helpin' out. 'tis especially advised at low levels 'n when attemptin' a challenge dungeon, as th' boss o' challenge dungeons has greatly increased health 'n power in return fer more EXP.
