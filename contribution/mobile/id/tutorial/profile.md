## Types of levels

### Player Level

This is the level all your other skills will be capped at. You can increase your player level by fighting in dungeons, fighting enemies and using Experience Memories. For the highest efficiency, you want to keep all your levels about even with your player level. This is recommended.

### Printing Rank

Printing rank determines the level of the equipment you will print at the 3D Molecular Printer. You can level your printing rank by printing equipment, Reverse Engineering Tech Scraps or working at a Printing Factory. The latter two options are AFK jobs at the Job Hub.

### Medical Science
Crafting medical items or initiating the relevant job at the Job Hub will give you medical crafting experience. You will need these levels to craft better healing items.

### Ammo Crafting

Crafting ammo or initiating a job at the Job Hub will give you ammo crafting experience. It's useful to craft more ammo with less materials.

### Scavenge Skill

To start scavenging, you must start at the lowest level area (Flori Station, Grandiose Parking Lot 1 - 4). As your scavenge skill improves, you can start to scavenge at higher levels. The level requirements are listed in those areas.

Higher scavenge levels will also grant you better rewards of (ammunition, military ammunition and medical) tech parts. You can only gain scavenge experience by scavenging.

### Mining Skill

Mining can be done only with 'Hash Processors' that drop from both normal and challenge dungeons.

Higher mining levels can earn you more BTC per 15 minutes of AFK mining. You can get mining experience by completing mining jobs at the Job Hub. With higher mining levels, you can craft AI cores more efficiently as well.
