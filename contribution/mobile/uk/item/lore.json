      "Used to be the peak technology of its time, mass manufacturing costs ${itemName} its reputation and quality. Nothing more than a ${tierName} of its fate.",
      "Nothing more than an abandoned artifactâ€”although, 'artifact' seems to imply some degree of significance. Maybe less of an artifact than just detritus. Then again, these ${itemType} were only as 'functional' as they needed to be.",
