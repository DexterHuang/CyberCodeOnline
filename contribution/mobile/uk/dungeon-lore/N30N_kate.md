#### N30N C1RCUS: Cat Lady

_"I guess that's as good as it gets"_ _Celes_ said to the cat purring sleepily on her lap. The plan looked solid - on paper least - and WAP was all briefed and good to go. It was just .. something at the back of her mind, niggling. Maybe it was just that the last op hadn't gone all that well and she didn't know why? The mobs' hadn't been .. surprised enough.

_"Dunno kitty cat, maybe I'm just imagining things?"_. _"And starting to talk to cats too"_ she sighed.

She rubbed her tired eyes and leant back, resisting the need to go over it all again. Just one more time.

Sensing that its lap was about to disappear, the cat stood, stretched and then leapt lightly to the floor. Bumped its head against her leg in farewell and stalked to the door, tail waving slightly in warning. It looked back once and then padded away silently. Heading home in the dark of the night. To _Kate_.
