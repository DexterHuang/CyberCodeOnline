#### N30N C1RCUS: Lost Princess

> You find a scavenged camcorder next to a pile of crusty unusable legendary cache. Upon picking it up, you see that it is already playing a video through the viewfinder.

*"Look at our little princess, she looks just like you." "But her mustache is out of control, when is she gonna shave it off?" "Oh hush, you gave her that plastic thing. She loves it more than her best toys." "She sure* ---"
> Video cuts to a new scene.

*"--- and Mr. Fuzzybear, don't forget to share your tea with Mrs. Bunbun. Here you go Mrs. Bunbun. Oh, Mr. Fuzzybear, who is your new friend? Sir Silly Penguin? Hello Mr. Silly, my name is--" "Sweetie! I told you not to bring in things from the garb---*" 
> Video cuts. 

*"---given them everything! We had all we needed and more, so why would--"* Knock knock knock. *"..Gloria take her through the back, now. And make her turn that thing---"*
> Video cuts. It's now just a scrolling night view of inner Shangri-La from an open hypertrain window. Trumpets and crowds can be heard as fireworks explode in the sky above glowing tents.

*"Honk!" "Hush now, you silly penguin!" "Honk!" "Can't you see the lass is crying, have sympathy!" "Honk honk!" "--Sniff... It's okay. I'm ready to go.." "And your fancy shoes, lass? That platinum ring? The retro camcorder, you shouldn't leave it here, it's worth a fortune in bitcoin!" "..Expensive things never made me happy." "..Honk!" "Hush it! Well then, come on now.. I'll tell you all about the N30N C---"*
> The voices get further away as the view of Shangri-la carries on for several minutes. A sound nearby reminds you that you were in the middle of exploring. Unsure how long the video goes before it inevitably repeats itself, you finally set the camcorder back down where you found it.
