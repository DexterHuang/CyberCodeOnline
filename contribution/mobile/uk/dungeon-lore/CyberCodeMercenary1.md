# A Secret Human Modification Military Project
> (part 1 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

The invention of the first Cybernetic Cerebral Enhancement implant in 2050 allowed the human brain to directly communicate with digital devices for the first time. This breakthrough made it possible for bionic prosthetics to finally outperform their biological counterparts by allowing full sensory information to be passed to the brain without any invasive procedures.  

The military, of course, saw the potential to enhance soldiers' physical capabilities beyond normal human beings. Thus, the "Cyber Code" project was started, with the goal to push the limits of both physical and mental faculties of a human and create the superior soldier.
