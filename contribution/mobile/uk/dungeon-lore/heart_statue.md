>As you enter the room, an oddly shaped piece of rock catches your curiosity. You walk up to it for closer inspection.  
  
> A heart-shaped stone statue. Upon closer inspection, there's a smaller heart etched within the stone heart in greater detail. You are not sure how this artistic piece of work ended up here. You stare at this statue at great length. After a while, you swear you were hallucinating and can hear a faint heartbeat, echoing, in another room. You get the feeling that this statue could have given you some much needed vigor for your journey ahead.  
  
>You put the statue back where you found it, carefully.
