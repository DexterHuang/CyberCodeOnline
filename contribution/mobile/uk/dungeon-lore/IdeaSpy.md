Episode 1

Shangri-LA. Here in the city where dreams come true and desires rule, something is
being bought, sold and thrown away, even as we speak. But behind the scenes of
business as usual, the nefarious A.E. (Arasaka Expensive) Corporation lines its
already bloated coffers with profits from worthless products. As A.E. swindles
yet another innocent into purchasing high-priced junk...the DHI mobilizes a
top-secret task force to put a stop to the menace. Now, the city's best-kept
secret spy is out there, briefed and ready to protect the people from A.E., the
catalogue of conspiracy -- just call him 2.5 (Two-point-five).
