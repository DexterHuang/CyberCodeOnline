*Angel come back, I'm sorry...*

*You said what you needed to say, now just leave me alone.*

*It's not you, you're beautiful and smart and funny...After Geoff...I just am not in a good place right now. Maybe if you give me some time?*

*I don't know how much time I have left.*

*What does that mean?*

*It means I don't believe in what this society has to offer anymore.*

*Okay, I know we just got out of government studies but what the heck are you talking about? You're not thinking of going dark are you?*

*Maybe. I don't know. I'm just so sick of megacorps and the government screwing over the little guy while generations just get poorer and poorer and continue to serve those rich, greedy bougies. Maybe I can do something about that. You know,  you're welcome to come with me.*

*Are you joking? My parents would kill me! And that's if I ever saw them again. Plus, I've heard horror stories about people that go dark.*

*So I guess this is it then.*

*Will you stay with me tonight? One last night before we say goodbye.*

*Well Helena Jones, since you are queen of the school and all, I suppose I couldn't say no to royalty.*
