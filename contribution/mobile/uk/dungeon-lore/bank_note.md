>A bank note. A real one this time. One that was from a bygone era, before the globalization of use and acceptance of Bitcoins came to be. A thin piece of paper, you suspect, made from a blend of materials. What was once green has long been faded by the surrounding environment and time. You can faintly make out the number "1" and "0". A tagline of sorts is no longer legible, not without the help of a microscope and perhaps a historian on the subject.  
  
>You put the bank note back on the ground for someone else to appreciate its history.
