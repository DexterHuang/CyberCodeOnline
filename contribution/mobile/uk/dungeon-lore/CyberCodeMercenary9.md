# Cyber Code Mercenaries as an Elite Military Combat Unit
> (part 9 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

Most rebel forces and criminal groups have access to black market vendors dealing with illegal cybernetic and neural enhancements, which makes them surpass the common military soldier in combat strength. Most common soldiers and police do not have the levels of cerebral and bionic enhancements would lose in any confrontations against such groups. Thus for any situation that has any chance of confrontation against cybernetically enhanced individuals, the task to handle them falls to the Cyber Code Mercenary Group. Having the cutting edge cybernetic implants, bionic limbs, titanium endoskeleton and military grade Cerebral Accelerators, they are unmatched in combat strength and prowess. Currently there has been no known record of Cyber Code Mercenaries failing a mission, there are some cases of casualties causing critical failure of the unit's body, but the neural implant instantly transfers the conciousness to the nearest backup clone body facility thus allowing them to "respawn" if ever slain in battle.
