>As you pass through from the last room, an impressive piece of metal grabs your curiosity. With a few maneuvers, you manage to get closer to it.  
  
>An analyzer. At least, you **THINK** it is called that, from an old Librarium E-file. Out of pure instinct, you tried to put it on your head. It fits perfectly, almost as though it was made just for you. A singular dark-greenish lense attached to half headband, half glasses frame situation. The lense is a bit cracked from the lack of care over the years. You tried turning it on with the power button, except you couldn't find one. You imagine this device could have made you understand how strong someone or something is.  
  
>You take off the analyzer and put it back on the ground, leaving it for someone else to ponder over what kind of technology it was.
