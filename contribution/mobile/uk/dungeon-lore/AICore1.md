# Mass Adoption of AI in Daily Life
> (Part 1 of 8 aicore series)

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. Historically, creating a general AI that can solve common human problems and tasks was a very difficult premise. Most of the AI developed in history only excelled at one specific task and failed at others. 

Since the breakthrough in quantum computer technology that happened in 2044, computing power has increased exponentially - even exceeding Moore's Law, which states computing speed doubles every two years. With current computers being so much more powerful, more generalized AI can be implemented. Nowadays, AI is everywhere, from your Aerial Autonomous Vehicle to your coffee maker. AI enables even simple items to be able to "think" like a human. We often take for granted our daily appliances that can predict what we might like for dinner, make coffee before we realize we need one, toast bread when you get out of bed and think about toast, or in the case of television, can choose a channel you will definitely enjoy watching.
