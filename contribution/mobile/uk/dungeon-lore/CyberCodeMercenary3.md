# Surpassing the Physical Limitations of the Mortal Body
> (part 3 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

The first clinical trials to install high powered bionic limbs caused bone fractures and major trauma to the wearer as the human body is not designed to handle such high forces. Varying ways of attaching the bionic limb attachment was tested to try and find a way around this limitation. Strapping them to the body non invasively did not work as the high powered bionics just tear the strap off, leaving the subject with minor bruises and chafing. While the polar opposite solution to attach the bionics directly to the skeletal structure caused major complications as the human bone structure cannot handle the forces involved. The researchers came to the conclusion that the subjects need a full replacement of their skeletal structure with high tensile strength titanium alloy to be able to finally withstand the forces involved with superhuman strength and agility. Having superhuman strength and agility made the body hard to control, because the brain cannot process movement information at a high enough speed to match the bionic augmentations. Attempts by researchers to address this problem laid the groundwork for later research into Cerebral Acceleration implants.
