Things are bad.  
  
The Followers had more power than we thought. The business district shuts down on the 25th, an old holdover from when more people celebrated Christmas. The Followers keep track of all those old holy days and tell people about how life was back before the Fall, and the Great War. They knew the district would be empty so they stormed in.  
  
But we were still there.  
  
All the corpos were at their fancy homes far away from all of this. They didn't see what we saw. They never did.  
  
The CEO called Sarge yesterday, when things were a little quieter. "How's the building?" He said. We lost 6 people in our squad. The Followers lost god knows how many more.  
  
I don't think I made the right choice any more.
