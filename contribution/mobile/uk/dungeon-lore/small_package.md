A small crack in the wall caught your eye. When you got closer and examined the gap, you decided to stick your hand in. Groping for a small package, you resolutely took it out and examined it. The package contained a holographic video recording and a small, incomprehensible object.

> Dear, take this artifact to our buyer, he promised a good price for it. Unfortunately, I'm not going home. ~~white noise~~ haunts me. ~~white noise~~ hope for you! Your ~~white noise~~

Without knowing the name of the person who left it here, you decided to leave the artifact in the place where you found it and continue your journey.
