Today's spotlight is on the biohazard accident that hit IntelliCo. Neural Implants Manufacturing Facility in Shangri-La Depot 33 district.

Police are blaming human error, apparently originating from the company's lax safety practices. As a result of company negligence, an airborne nerve agent was inadvertently released in the office building. 

400 employees are dead, among them the whole research department. A serious blow for the rapidly growing company.

IntelliCo. shares went down 98% in a matter of hours, with little to none chance of recovery in sight.
