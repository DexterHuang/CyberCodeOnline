>A small glint in the room catches your eye. You get closer to see what it is.  
  
>A circular device. Perfectly round, fits in the palm of your hand like a glove. You wonder how this ended up in the middle of nowhere. You look at the ball in your hand. Some kind of button in the middle of the device. You click it. Nothing happens. The button seems to be jammed or something. The device itself is very rusted, with barely a hint of red and white showing. It's lightweight and hollow, almost as if it was meant to transport something. Small, of course. You tossed the ball at the wall to be silly, hoping something would pop out. You were soundly met with disappointment. It fell back on the ground after hitting the wall with a "tink" sound.  
  
>You leave the ball where it fell. Leaving it for the next person to be met with the same disappointment you found yourself in.
