# New Cybernetic Virus AiK0r3 Halts Cyber Code Mercenary Force
> CCO Bug / Real Event : Players kicked out of dungeons every 30 seconds

On 6th May 2077 a new variant of cybernetic virus was discovered when a Cyber Code Mercenary mission to quell a rebellion in South New Jerson failed miserably. The mercenaries who retreated from the mission gave reports that their conciousness kept getting detached from their bodies repeatedly every 30 seconds. This caused the mercenaries to be unable to operate their bodies properly. Detailed analysis from neural cortex memory recordings show brain activity akin to using an AICORE. After finding remnants of the program from affected mercenaries' implants, experts have determined the mercenaries were hit with a new kind of cybernetic virus that mimics how an AICORE operates. The culprit virus was determined to be a cybernetic executable called AiK0r3.cyn bearing an encryption signature under the name ShellPhish. An antivirus routine to combat this malicious virus is currently in development, while authorities are still trying to apprehend the culprit avoiding further damage.
