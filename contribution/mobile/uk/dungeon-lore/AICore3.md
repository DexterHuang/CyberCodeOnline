# The Invention of Cerebral Acceleration
> (Part 3 of 8 aicore series)

The first prototype for Cerebral Acceleration was invented in the year 2061,  based on an obscure underground illegal Neuralink application: BB2039.nrl. The BB2039 app, better known as BrainBurst, was a secret application which allowed a person to make time subjectively "stop" by temporarily accelerating brain activity by 1024 times through a Neuralink device. This application also doubled as a fighting game where a person fights for "Burst Points" that they can consume to use the Cerebral Acceleration Function.

BrainBurst was soon made illegal after authorities discovered the app's ability to directly alter the memory of the losing players to forget any associated memories regarding BrainBurst, thus enabling the app to maintain its secrecy. Though BrainBurst itself had been outlawed, the research into Cerebral Acceleration the app had inspired was permitted to continue. 

After extensive research, development and regulatory hurdles, Cerebral Acceleration was finally approved for public use in 2068, allowing people to increase their brain processing speed and streamline their thought processes. This breakthrough in technology sparked a period of exponentially increased productivity in research and academia across a multitude of disciplines.

In daily use, Cerebral Acceleration is mainly employed as a learning aid allowing children to complete primary, secondary, and tertiary education by as early as 10 years old, with knowledge on par with the archaic Master's Degree. Cerebral Acceleration also has its uses in the military and industrial sectors to increase concentration and reaction time, preventing work accidents and improving productivity.
