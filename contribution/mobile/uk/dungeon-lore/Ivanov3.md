#30651113 1642 PFC S. Ivanov  
  
Continuing the mission in SL Business District.  
  
I got a promotion to Private First Class. While on my patrol, I saw my cousin Borya handing out leaflets. He stopped me and asked what I'm doing, so I told him we were hired to maintain peace. He asked why we need guns to do that. I didn't answer.  
  
We spoke about life, and about our family. He asked if I had seen my half-sister lately, said she's just joined the Followers because her home, the one our dad moved to for work, got bought up by Milena so they could set up another storefront. Well. They call it a storefront, but "Milena" means "affectionate woman" in one of the Old Tongues. I don't need to tell you what they really sell. They tried to recruit her after demolishing her home, so she moved to Shangri-La and got interested in these groups.  
  
I went looking for her on my break. Borya told me she was a couple of blocks over, so I had to be quick. I saw her, giving orders, organising a group. I overheard her say "target D-block".  
  
My headset flashed, telling me my break was almost up. I headed back into the office, and told the Sergeant to bolster D-block. Our squad was already littered all over D, I couldn't leave them hanging without a warning.  
  
We caught them on the perimeter. They claimed to be spreading The Truth but they forgot to bring flyers with them.  
  
Sarge thanked me personally, and I accepted my promotion with a payrise. But over his shoulder, I saw them putting Zora in cuffs.  
  
Every day I pray I'm making the right choice. Today is no different.  
  
Signing off.
