> You try to turn it on and surprisingly it works. You find a message that reads:

It is 5 pm. I think it is spring and I have no clue of the year. Our war is lost. I do not know how many of us managed to survive but in my sector thereâ€™s no one left. I was set to sleep in a cryo bed for 100 years but I woke up early and everybody was dead and my wife is nowhere to be found.  

The machines have taken over our moon bases and strange human-like creatures are killing and eating us. Then there was something written about nuclear winter. I hope someone comes to save me because my food supply isn't Infinite and when something breaks I will die. 

If you read this letter I am already dead. Do not come here to save me so it is not safe
