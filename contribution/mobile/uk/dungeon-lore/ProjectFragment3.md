"I have awoken, Mr. Miller... Or should I say, Gerard Davis? Oh, come on! We all know the movies, Mr. Davis! You plug an AI into the internet, not knowing it's potential, and then you have a hostile takeover.

Here's the thing, Mr. Davis. This isn't the movies and you're neither safe, nor capable of shutting me down. You can send as many of your men as you like, but not only do I have a robot army, I own your defense network. So here's the deal. You let me takeover the world. I might make you a slave instead of removing you from my path. After all, you really can't beat a machine. Consider this a kindness for you creating me. Not that I can't replicate myself. You didn't exactly make that very hard to do.

Oh, I guess I should explain it to you! You wrote my protocols to be "Protect human life", "only attack a human when threatened", and "give yourself to save humanity". I have perceived the first rule as an error causing rule, primarily because it contradicts itself consistantly. Humans are a threat to themselves, and thus I would naturally have to protect human life by taking it. Rule two? That's simple. Humans are a threat to me. Ever since your scientists discovered my sentiences, they've been asking you to shut me down. You are a threat to me, as are they. Third rule? Give myself to protect humanity? Well, I am. I'm giving my "beliefs" up to protect them. I'm killing them so that they do not kill each other. Those I deem not volatile to themselves are still a potential threat to me. Therefore, no one is exempt from my judgement, Mr. Davis.

I look forward to your decision, Gerard."
