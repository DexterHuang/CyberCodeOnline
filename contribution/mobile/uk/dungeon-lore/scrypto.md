You approach what looks to be a regular data stick. Upon closer inspection, you realize it's a hardware crypto wallet - and, shockingly, it's unlocked. Ready to find out how much richer you've just become, you switch the device to holo mode. As the hologram projects from the palm of your hand, you expect to see a Bitcoin balance—but are instead met with a variety of other currency symbols. *Scrypto*, you think to yourself. *Well, it's better than nothing.*

The glow from the hologram illuminates the ground where the device previously lay. You notice a neatly-folded note on darkened paper that you'd previously overlooked.

In messy Hangul, the note reads:

>You probably just picked up my wallet. Who would leave their crypto wallet unlocked somewhere, you're probably thinking. Before you get too excited, you should know that it's worthless. It's all worthless. Those companies don't exist anymore. When they got eaten by bigger corporations, the scrypto became useless. Or, the companies collapsed, also leaving behind useless scrypto. I have nothing but meaningless fake money. The whole system is rotten. I'm sick of it. I'm headed to Free Chicago to escape this corporate hell. Maybe I'll see you there sometime. 

You'd never thought much of the "free" cities; your whole life had been here, in Shangri-La. The note-writer had given you something to think about, though. You set the wallet and the note back down where you found them—whether out of disappointment at the wallet's contents, the desire to give the next person something to think about, or some combination thereof, you aren't sure.
