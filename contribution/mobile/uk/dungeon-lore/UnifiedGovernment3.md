# Critics of the Unified Global Government
> (Part 3 of 6 WGO Series)

Critics of world government come from a wide political spectrum, from radical left to far-right political adherents. Critics have offered three main objections regarding the feasibility, desirability, and necessity of establishing a common global political authority. 

First, a hastily formed unification of the political system might not bring global peace, but endless global insurgency and civil wars. By having a central figure of political power, critics claim, it is inevitable that minority groups would end up trying to gain independence by violent means. 

Second, the only stable system would be a fully unified world state that has the monopoly on legitimate coercive power, which means the central political power would have absolute power to destroy the whole world on a whim. 

Finally, critics argue that it is more important to address issues of poverty, inequality, and global justice than to try to ensure an absolute power governing above all, which in turn would potentially just cause more of the aforementioned problems.
