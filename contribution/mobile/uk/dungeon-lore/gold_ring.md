>Stepping into the room, a faint glint from what you think is a huge earring catches your eye. You take a few big strides to get a better look.  
  
>An unusually large metallic ring. Not any type of currency you see around these parts. You wonder how it got here. You take a closer look at this ring. Scratched and worn beyond recognition from its original state, it is surprisingly hollow and lightweight. You tap it lightly against the ground; it makes a springy **clink** sound. You can see that what once was gold has long faded and rusted from the surrounding moisture. You have an unspeakable and unexplained urge to collect these rings; LOTS of these rings.  
  
>You reluctantly put it back on the ground, for someone else to fawn and obsess over the once gold ring.
