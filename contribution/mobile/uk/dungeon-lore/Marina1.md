I guess I don't know how to start this log- but my father gave me this diary as a gift to write my thoughts, so I'll try to use it!  
He always says that habits are built from the hard work of those who want tru change, and I know I want change for us! He was so sad when mom died, I want us to be happy.  
I guess I can introduce myself like I would to a friend, right?  
Hi! nice to meet you! I'm Marina. I'm 12, have long black hair, and I like synth cherries. I have a dad and a big brother. Mom died five years ago. Dad says she was defending the Omnipotent God and protecting us. I know she keeps us safe from the net now (hi mom). We are scavengers and merchants. My dad lives outside the city. We travel, collect the best parts, and sell them at the best price!  
Every day my schedule looks like this:  
  
Wake up 5  
Prayer 5:30-6:30  
Eat 7:00  
Help work 7:30-11  
Lunch 11-12  
Scripture 12-4  
Make dinner 4-5  
Eat, shower, sleep 5-7  
  
I know it's a little boring but i like it! My favorite days are Saturdays because I can go to the chapel and connect to the net with the Family.
