We have established our presence in the SL Business District. Been here for a week now. We are set up on the ground floor of Z-Corp's building. They sell a lot of tech caches, so we have better equipment than we're used to. Some of the squad have taken to playing around with their stats. Bugsy says a high-stun build is the best for one-on-one combat but I've always been a high-crit man myself. I imagine by the end of this we'll have more info about weaponry, what works, and what doesn't.  
  
We're not the only private contractors here. EnhanceU has their own squad that just moved in yesterday, and TruMatch had one before we got here. That's just the ones on our block. This district is huge, so I'm sure all the military kids are eating well right now.  
  
Speaking of eating well, even the food stalls are hiring security. Some of them are on the other side, think The Followers have a point. Most of them are from the outskirts of Shangri-La and just want to protect their families.  
  
The Followers are getting twitchy. They seem to be stocking up on weaponry and upgrading their gear. They're no match for us, but they're putting on an entertaining show.  
  
Tensions are high, but if we play our cards right things will be okay and we'll be back to the status quo soon.  
  
Signing off.
