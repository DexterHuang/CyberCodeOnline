[Recovered Data Entry - Audiolog of Billy Braxton - Scav]

**START OF AUDIOLOG**
>_I was sent out to clean up an old Medical Building, Good old OmniMedica, Good Old Pandemonium, it's been a while since I was last here._

>_Pretty typical of these old abandoned buildings, tons of droids just left over, half of cabinets already torn through, most tech scavenged of anything useful._

>_They sent me to come retrieve an old tech left deep in the basement, down where they left the decommissioned droids._

>_Of course I had heard that some of these decommissioned droids were down here once they got stuck in a bad loop. It would start with odd conversations with patrons._
 
 > **_There is a loud crash and another voice is heard faintly in the distance however unintelligible. Heavy footsteps can be heard below._**

>_Ah damn, I was told it was just me here._

>**_There is a long break in monologue, only heavy breathing and the sound of heavy footsteps growing louder._**

>_No way! Oh man, no no no no no. OVERRIDE CODE 00189273, Ah shit._

>**_A metallic voice belts; "YOU WILL PAY FOR RAKKON"_**

>**_There is a loud crack, a squish, and a thud. Shortly after the audio cuts._**
