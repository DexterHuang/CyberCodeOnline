#### N30N C1RCUS: Fettucini

_Fettucini_ - only his mother had ever called him _Alfredo_ - was cheerfully trying to shake down the proprietor of _Hui's Happy Noodles_ when he heard the door to the takeout place open. Without looking around, he pointed his gun at the door and said:

_"Out!"_

He was more than somewhat surprised to find his own gun being gently pointed at the ceiling while he was spun around to look into a level pair of grey-blue eyes below a wild thatch of straw-coloured hair. 

_".38 special?"_ said a nondescript voice calmly. _"Bit retro isn't it? Now this .. "_, waving something a whole lot more complicated in the hand that wasn't occupied with Fett's pistol, _".. is an Alpha Thermal Pistol of Precision, Legendary model. Palm recognition, extended mag's, LIDAR target acquisition and cybernetic sights. Hand loaded smart ammo of course, and it can put 6 rounds in a 5cm circle at 200 feet in under 2 seconds"_.

Fettucini looked at the dude, baffled:

_"Uh, dat's nice man, but what's it gotta do wit' me?"_  
_"Oh, just thought you might find it interesting"_

And then Fettucini, not generally regarded as being the brightest candle on the cake, did something so indescribably stupid that even he was not all that surprised to find himself sitting on the floor with his back against the counter, looking at the spreading stain on his chest.

  _".. cybersomethin' sights, hand-loaded .. "_ he thought, _".. good to know"_, before everything faded.

_Hui_ pushed a brown bag of takeout across the counter:

_"Your order Mr Worzel sir. No charge!"_  
_"Nonsense Hui, of course I'll pay for it! And sorry about the mess - this should cover it!"_, sliding two hash across the counter.  
_"No worries, Mr Worzel sir. You have good evening, Mr Worzel sir"_
