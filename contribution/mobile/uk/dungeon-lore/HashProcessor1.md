# The History of BitCoin Mining
> (Part 1 of 8 hash processor series)

BitCoin mining is the process by which new Bitcoins are added into circulation, but it is also a critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger. It is performed using very sophisticated computers that solve extremely complex computational math problems.  

Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and rarely rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a huge appeal for many investors interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners are rewarded for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven. BitCoin miners receive Bitcoin as a reward for completing "blocks" of verified transactions which are added to the blockchain. Mining rewards are paid to the miner who discovers a solution to a complex mathematical puzzle first, and the probability that a participant will find the solution is proportionate to the how many people are mining in the network.
