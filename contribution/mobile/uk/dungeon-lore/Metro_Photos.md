How odd... it's a series of instant photos, each depicting the Shangri-La metro map posted at different nearby stations. You wonder if they're part of an art project or simply the documentation of a fanatic's transit obsession. Perhaps the snapshots were taken by the designer of the map, pleased with their work? Or, maybe, the photographs were _intended_ to be left here, as some sort of signal to an unknown party? 

Regardless, it feels strangely invasive to pocket the photos, so you leave them right where they are. You're content to spend a while conjuring up reasons the photos might have been taken in the first place and how and why they ended up here. Sometimes life needs small mysteries.
