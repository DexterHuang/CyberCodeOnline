# Proponents of the Unified Global Government
> (Part 2 of 6 WGO Series)

Proponents of world government offer distinct reasons for why it is an ideal or necessary form of political organization. Some are motivated negatively and see world government as the definitive solution to problems in society such as war and the development of weapons of mass destruction, poverty, inequality, financial instability, infectious disease, pandemics, environmental degradation and climate change. More positively, some have advocated world government as a step to prosperity and global cooperation and happiness. A unified global government could implement socialized health care across regions. It could shoulder the economic tasks formerly left to regional trading blocs. It could provide for passportless free and unrestricted movement of people across borders, much as the Schengen Area once did in Europe. 

Proponents have also differed historically in their views of the form of government that a world state should take. While historically people advocated world government under a single monarch or emperor who would possess supreme authority over all other lesser rulers, current proponents of world government generally still advocate a devolved sovereign state system to move humanity toward pacific world federalism.
