# The Invention of AICORE
> (Part 5 of 8 aicore series)

Artificial Intelligence Cerebral Operation and Replication Engines, or AICORE for short, are sophisticated self-aware AI that are an indispensable part of our daily lives. We now take for granted the AICOREs that help us make decisions, automatically control our electronic devices without even consciously thinking, and allow us to obtain the ability to do certain tasks skillfully even without any prior experience or training. AICOREs also has the ability to set your body to "autopilot" by letting the AICORE control your body while you can detach your consciousness and go to the CyberNet. 

AICORE first started development in 2057 as a Japanese military project. The project aimed to streamline the control mechanism of dual-pilot Mecha Suits to allow for solo piloting by using AICORE, rather than an additional person, to supplement the first pilot. By 2060, the first functional AICORE was completed and successfully allowed the first instance of true multitasking in a human brain.
