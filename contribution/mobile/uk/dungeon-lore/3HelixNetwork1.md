>You can hear a crowd of people have gathered here. Noise of the TV with the news on can be heard.  
  
**Woman's voice:**"Happy Birthday sweetheart!"  
**Child's voice:**"Thanks mom!"  
**Woman's voice:**"Make a wis---"  
  
>The woman's voice is loudly interrupted by a crackling and high-pitched tone.  
  
**Deep Man's Voice**:"Citizens of Shangri-La. You have been deceived. You cannot trust your government or even your supposed "free and open" information source to be relied on. You have been brainwashed and lied to. At this very moment, your mayor is making a shady, backalley deal with one of the most corrupt financial institutions here in the city. Your media news outlets have been paid to deceive and lie to their citizens, intending to cover up the story so the mayor can appear to bring the city into a new age of technology. This has been a courtesy announcement and wake up call from The 3Helix Network. We have given you the information. Do what you will."  
  
>The announcement cuts off just as the media playback stops.
