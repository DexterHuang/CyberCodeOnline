# Maikon Quantum Semiconductors
> (Part 8 of 8 hash processor series)

Maikon Quantum Semiconductors was founded in 2039 as a startup company aiming to bring quantum processors to the market in an industrial scale. The company went through alot of obstacles, one of them being pressure from financial firms and security experts, worrying that the exponentially superior power of quantum computers may make current security and encryption methods useless and insecure. Maikon almost went bankrupt when they were hit by a lawsuit from World United Bank (WUB) stating that their endeavors threaten the asset safety of billions of bank accounts, and accusing Maikon for having illegal goals in the quantum processor development. After a tough legal battle Maikon won the lawsuit and recieved compensation from WUB for defamation. After many hurdles Maikon finally became the first company to release a Quantum Processor Unit (QPU) as a commercial product. Their latest models are often kept within their own company to be used for BitCoin mining and after the hardware becomes obsolete, they are finally released to the public. This monopoly on BitCoin mining allowed Maikon to become a technological giant with obscene amounts of wealth and funds.
