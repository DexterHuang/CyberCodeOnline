# How BitCoins are Mined
> (Part 4 of 8 hash processor series)

BitCoin mining in general works by solving complex mathematical problems while verifying and updating transactional ledgers in the blockchain. Historically this was done using slow and inefficiant Central Processing Units (CPU) or Graphical Processing Units (GPU). With the increasing popularity of BitCoin Mining in the past, entrepreneurs started to produce dedicated tools to mine BitCoins called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). This has been the norm until the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) was invented in 2057. Mining BitCoin with QPUs were rife with controversy, because the company that produces them hoards all the latest and fastest units causing all other miners to have inferior mining tools. This problem was left unchecked until the World Government Organization finally declared BitCoin as legal tender and added regulations to BitCoin mining to only use government approved QPUs called Hash Processors.
