You come across a strange isolated room, blocked by an hospital-style automatic door. You can clearly see behind the door is some sort of empty single patient room, and no one is inside. Strangely, the lights are intact, the bed and drawer look surprising clean, and you break in easily. In fact, the door isn't even locked, leaving you wondering was someone just inside.

The very first thing you catch glimpse of is an old gramophone on the top of drawer. There isn't other thing of interest, including that patient bed with white sheets, an IV stand with no IV pack, and no other decorations.

The gramophone is loaded with an old large disk, and several labels are crudely pasted at the sides of the machine, all with old fonts written on it with:

> E. A. T. E. O. T

This looks like some sort of maniac was desperately trying to name the gramophone, but all the labels strangely avoid the disc at a good distance. You also notice the top of drawer is scribed with incomprehensible letters.

Out of curiosity, you press the play button on the gramophone and it soon plays some sort of ancient music with slightly muffled noise. As you look around the room and across the door window, a sudden unbearable pain cracks into your skull, as if something sharp just invades your brain from an impossible angle.

You stumble to stop the gramophone before the music gets louder and louder, and crawl out of the room, still dizzy of its tone.
