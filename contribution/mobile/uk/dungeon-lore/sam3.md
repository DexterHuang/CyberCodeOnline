`[Part 3 of 4]`

`SURVELLANCE FOOTAGE ACCESSED; REPLAYING DATA FROM JULY 7TH, 2076, AT 2:01:04 AM`

The footage shows an empty, gray room, with only a table, two chairs, and a door across from Sam, who is sitting in one of the chairs, hand-cuffed. A moment later, and the door opens to reveal what seems to be a well-dressed young lady. She walks over to the empty chair, and takes a seat. Sam looks absolutely destroyed, his face red, and his eyes baggy. The woman sits for a minute, before finally opening, "We know what happened. We only want to know if you'd be willing to participate."

Sam doesn't respond. He's still very clearly broken, and has noticeable bruises on his body. After a moment, he finally murmurs, "Participate in what...?" The woman, completely unfazed by his situation, quickly responds, "The Blitzers. We know they're killing innocent people, but we don't have the evidence to arrest them. You, however, may be innocent, but you attempted to cheat on your significant other, Jessica Honely, and this is the price you're paying. And we're presenting you with an opportunity. Sacrifice yourself, and bring the Blitzer's chaos to light. Or, die like the rest of their victims."

Sam lays his head on the table. The room is quiet for a few minutes. Sam finally lifts his head back up, his face still red, and his eyes watery. He quietly mumbles, "What kind of cops are you..."

The woman leans back in her chair. "We're worse than the cops."
