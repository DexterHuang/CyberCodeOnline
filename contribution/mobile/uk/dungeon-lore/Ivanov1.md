We have been contracted by Zodiac Corp to initiate a strong military presence in Shangri-La Business District.  
  
Police Department reportedly overwhelmed by scavs, fanatics, and other undesirables.  
  
Rumours of an uprising. The Followers are recruiting at an extreme rate and threatening another revolution. Military presence required to squash this and maintain order.  
  
No current anticipation of required force or civilian casualties.  
  
My squad is in two minds. Half of them are excited to finally see action, half of them have family in The Followers and worry about meeting them. We're all happy about the pay though. Private military pays surprisingly well, and revolutions are good for business.  
  
I pray I made the right choice.  
  
Signing off.
