Nakamoto-sama,  

As you requested, I'm contacting you with a status update on the development of the neural backup and recovery technology.  

The latest test utilized D-MAVID storage (Distributed Massive Array of Virtual Idle Disks) with a 34.8% success rate. The success cases were reimaged into new frames in seconds, without complication.  
We should be ready to begin field testing in a matter of weeks.  
  
To that end, will the board please provide a specialist to assist with propagation of the D-MAVID botnet across the web? Subtlety will be paramount.

Thank you again for BT Civilization's continued support,  
Chrysalis
