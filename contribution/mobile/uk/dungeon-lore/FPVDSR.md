> Looking for equipment in the dungeon, you find a data log of an old recon team sent by Vitasyntech Labs. It bursts to life in your hands.

<Data Log 1> 

[UA Pilot Name: "TmVmZl9GUFY="]
[Recon team: Delta 5]

Vitasyntech hired "super soldiers", at least thats what they called us, for a "on the books" routine inspection of an IntelliCo company lab in the Shangri-La Depot 33 District.

The OP is simple: get in, have a look around, dig up the skeletons in the closet, and get out.

The entire meeting was, less than ideal, for my liking... but the money was too good to pass up.

14,000,000 BTC and 20,000 Units. 

How could me and my team pass that up. It was too good to be true. 

I can live a happy life with my family again. Not stuck under the WGO's oppressive thumb towards us military vets any longer. Forcing us to go out and do their work, for as little pay as 20,000 BTC a year. Screw that!

This pilot sacrificed his years doing FPVDSR / (First Person View Drone Swarm Recon) / for over 30 years for them! And for what?! Getting shot at?!

Luckily thats gonna change very soon. I can get away and finally live in peace. Give my son, wife, and daughter the life they want, what I want.
