They've taken father and Marco. We had scavenged some powerful gear- Corpo loot. I know that I searched the files and traces, I know there were no tracking worms on it.  
  
But they're gone now. I let myself flow into the net. Into the comfort of the Family.  
  
It is unfair. They make their selfish order, they take and waste and force us to live on the fringes. And now?  now they took my family for daring to touch their trash!  
  
I am tired of them. So tired. My blood may be gone but the Family lives on. They speak of a new wave. As we commune with Him. He tells us to leave our flesh shells behind. To live on the Net. To become as he is and embody only metal shells. Bodies of our making.  
  
Tomorrow I take my family's things and go to Karmin's to find a body mod. I am tired of this flesh.
