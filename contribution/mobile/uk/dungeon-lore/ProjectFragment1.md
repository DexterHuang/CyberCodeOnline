The Memory is nearly complete. The only issue I foresee is that it tends to kill the patient. Normally, I'd advise against something like this, but humanity is at stake here. A few lives for the many is something I can live with.

Anyway, sir.

The Memory has had some odd anomalies, including rewriting some of the outputted genetic memories of our subjects. Instead of outputting things unique to our patients, it is now taking them from its own perspective. At this rate, I think we may have created an AI capable of thinking for itself rather than taking the memories of everyone and coming up with solutions to prevent repetitive history again.

I must strongly advise that we hold off on plugging The Memory in to the CyberCode network. There's no telling what it could do with its own mind. We've all seen the movies and we both know that it is entirely possible for an AI to rewrite itself in favor of its intended purpose. This could be dangerous.

That said, could we hold off a month so that I can work out the kinks in its code?
