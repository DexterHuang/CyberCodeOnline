As you wander through the ruins of the city, you find a suspicious warehouse with high security, but you realize you are running out of ammunition and medical supplies.

You returned to Shangri-La, remembering its location.
And you posted a job posting on the network.

Within minutes, three strangers came in and you made contact with them.

One was dressed like a biker with spikes from head to toe.
Another was dressed in a mohican head with a rag-like thong that was not known to be clothing or ornaments.
The other was wearing a weird mask and unknown bone fragments and dolls on his waist.

You took the lead by explaining that there were good things to 'borrow' nearby.

Then there was a noise from behind.

Sensing the somthing wrong, you immediately pulled out your gun and aimed at them, but your vision shook and a dull shock came over you.
You felt anger and emptiness, and you fell down.

After a while, you feel alive and get up.
You looked around and found a warehouse full of waste, a box full of ammunition and painkillers, and a note.

>Beware of putpockets!
