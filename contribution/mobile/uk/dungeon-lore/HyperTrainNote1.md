*[Looks like a live recording from a long time ago. You press the play button. It's a stout, bald man speaking in front of the Hyper Train.]*  
  
"Today marks a great achievement ***[bad feedback noise]*** for the bustling metropolis of Shangri-La City. As the mayor of this great city, I am *PROUD* ***[the man presses his mouth against the microphone]*** to reveal and announce the inauguration of the NEW Hyper Train!!!"  
  
>The mayor gestures and a big, white canvas is lifted off to reveal the brand new, state-of-the-art Hyper Train. The Mayor continues to speak after a somewhat dramatic reveal.  
  
"This state of the art transportation will be able to take the fine citizens of this city (points to the crowd) anywhere in the world - any continent in a matter of minutes!"  
  
*[The video stops abruptly as the sound and recording cuts out badly.]*
