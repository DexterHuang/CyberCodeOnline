>Making an abrupt entrance, you noticed a pile of oddly shaped metal. Trying to distract yourself from the 5 monsters you just killed, you walk up for a closer look.  
  
> A pile of what appears to be throwing weapons. You recall an old E-file from the Librarium. There seems to be two different types here. A "kunai", or a throwing knife, and a "shuriken", or a throwing star. You take a closer look at these relics. You wonder if someone tried to use these as actual weapons, but ultimately falling. Rusted to a degree, but still sharpened in a way that you could cut yourself it you aren't too careful handling these. You chuck one at the wall in poor form. It barely wobbles towards the wall before making a loud "clunk" sound and falls to the ground.  

>You put the rest of the throwing weapons in a neat pile, so the next person can inspect these historic pieces without hurting themselves.
