**Location serviced:**  
The Broken Link, New Port City 

**Services rendered:**    
Recalibration of SAMEK unit, firmware updates, enabled force-update 

**Detailed description:**    
Folks over in New Port skimped on the service fees & hadn't had their SAMEK in for routine maintenance, or installed any of the firmware patches, since... seems since the bar's been in operation. 

Their SAMEK is housed in a repurposed surgical droid that went haywire. Seems patron ordered a Penicillin (they're pretty good, actually, honey and ginger and scotch... could use one right about now) which tripped some residual medical programming in the housing. Droid started trying to perform surgery on nearby patrons while the SAMEK AI gleefully announced it was inventing a cocktail with never-before-used ingredients. Wouldn't have been an issue if they'd have downloaded the firmware updates, we patched this issue ages ago.

Fortunately, no injuries. Gave the unit a thorough inspection and stayed there while firmware updates installed. Enabled force-update override as, in my personal assessment, the operators of The Broken Link have no interest in maintaining their SAMEK.
