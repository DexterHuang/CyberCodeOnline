# Hash Processors in Daily Life
> (Part 6 of 8 hash processor series)

Since the adoption of Hash Processors as the only legal way to mine BitCoins, many criminal organizations try to circumvent the regulations and rules to be able to mine at a higher speed or bypass the 15 minute single use limitation, and make more bitcoin than what it is designed to output. Hash Processors are distributed by the WGO as a Universal Basic Income. Each registered citizen with a Cerebral Accelerator is given 5 Hash Processors per month. Each Hash Processor generates approximately 1500 BitCoins after it finishes its mining cycle, then it is rendered useless because of the overclocking that is applied to low quality Quantum Processing Units to reduce costs. The 7000-8000 BitCoin basic income is enough to allow everyone to have a fullfilling and happy life even without a job. The amount given is desiged to be enough for daily food, shelter, and even consumptive purchases. More hash processors could be earned if a person wishes to buy more consumptive items, or live a more luxurious lifestyle by signing up for a job at the closest job center.
