>I don't know if I can take anymore of this. At first I thought the New Day Enlightenment thing was great. I came off the street after losing my job and my wife left me. I found one of their E-pamphlets when I was looking at the assignment board at the station. Free room and board, they even give you assignments from their own foundation. It's..... it's only been [redacted] and I am already [redacted] sanity. They are all smiles and [redacted] forgiveness, talking about how everyone has a right to the bounty of the planet, how everyone is equal and have something to offer the Great Father Earth. But [redacted] wrong. I just hope someone out there finds this record before these [redacted] finds it. Please, please, please. If anyone finds this and I am still alive, my name is [Redacted] Marcochev and please send help for me.
