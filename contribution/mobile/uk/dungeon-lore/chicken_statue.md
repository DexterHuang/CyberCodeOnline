>A funny shaped stone of some sort catches your eyes. You get closer to take a better look.  
  
>A petrified chicken. You are not sure how it ended up here, or what it is doing in the middle of nowhere to begin with. A small chicken, it seems, peaceful, harmless looking ordinary chicken. However, you get an eerie feeling that if you were to assault this harmless chicken, it would call on its brethren to badger and assault you back relentlessly.  
  
>You put the petrified chicken back where you found it, carefully.
