#### N30N C1RCUS: Sales and Marketing

The `MeshNet` terminal chimed with a request and a set of co-ordinates. 

_"Hmmmm.."_

Sera' packed up a full load-out of caseless, some armour-piercing and their new demo model (her being in sales 'n all), put up the
`GON` `OUT` `BIZY` `BACK` `SON` sign and happily locked the door to the _Wepponne Shoppe_. 

Tripp' was lying behind a low concrete parapet, swapping shots with somebody on a roof across the river. And yup, he was running low, the \*\*\*hole. Humming cheerfully, she leopard-crawled across below the parapet, and helpfully loaded up a full set of mags.

_"6 mags of ordinary on your left, 2 armour piercing on your right, should be enough .. oh, and I brought you this to try out.."_  
_"Thanks, you're an **angel**!"_  
_"Duh!! A seraphim is an angel, dummy! Sign here.."_. 

He reached back an arm without looking round and she scanned the QR code tattooed on his wrist.

_"'k, be good!"_

She patted him affectionately on the butt and made her way back across to the fire escape, pausing _ever_ so briefly to drop a frag grenade down the stairwell as a friendly welcome gift for the hoods trying to sneak up on a regular customer.

_"No charge"_ she called back over her shoulder, skipping happily out of there, her good deed for the day all done.
