# The Dawn of a Unified Global Government
> (Part 4 of 6 WGO Series)

There has never been an executive, legislature, judiciary, military, or constitution with global jurisdiction. The United Nations was limited to a mostly advisory role to foster cooperation between existing national governments rather than exert authority over them. This changed after MNE 11 and 12.

The MNE, or Multinational Experiment, is an international experiment which explored the uses of international power (diplomatic, information, military, and economic) to influence the behavior of adversaries. In brief: it is a military wargame that many nations participate in. MNE 11, held in the mid-2040s, ended precariously. All models predicted a heightened likelihood of devastating multinational conflict that the assembled governments would be unable to quell. By MNE 12 in the mid-2050s, it had become quite clear that the current models of government had failed to evolve alongside rapid advancements in technology. The exercises revealed that the assembled governments were even less capable of containing multinational conflict then than they had been during MNE 11. A drastic change would have to come to avert World War 3.

Thus, the World Government Organization (WGO) was formed on 21st September 2066 to ensure cooperation, surveillance, and development of the whole world. Its creation was spearheaded by the technologically innovative nations of China, Japan, and the United States in response to what old world Realpolitik analysts would consider alarming developments in civilization, particularly as evidenced by the outcomes of MNE12.
