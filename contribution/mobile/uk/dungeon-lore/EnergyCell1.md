Micro Thermonuclear Self Contained Fission Energy Cells, which people now colloquially call energy cells, are small self-contained energy generator units that come in various sizes. Energy cells now power every electronic device from HoloPhones to vehicles. Each cell is a self-contained fission reactor, complete with integrated smart electronics that can automatically match the required voltage and current needed by the device it is installed into. Long gone are the days where people need to charge their batteries daily to keep their devices running. One energy cell can supply continuous power to an electronic device for 12 years before needing replacement.
