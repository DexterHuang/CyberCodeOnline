# The Invention of Safer Portable Nuclear Power Sources
> (Page 2 of 2 Energy Cell Series)

Energy cells were invented in 2069 by scientists from Shangri-La BioTech as a potential solution to the energy crisis amid the economic boom brought by cybernetic enhancements. The original energy cells called "Micro Thermonuclear Self Contained Fission Energy Cells" had the size of a rugby ball; the cells were used primarily as a power source for powered exosuits and vehicles. Energy cells are portable fission reactors that use inert helium isotopes that have a very solid safety track record versus their predecessors, microfusion cells which use flammable and explosive hydrogen isotopes contained under very high pressures that may explode and fail catastrophically if the cell is dropped, punctured, or stored improperly. The No. 2371 size energy cell uses the archaic standard AA battery cell format and is rated provide a constant supply of 12400 DC volts. This model is commonly used as a power source for energy based anti personnel weapons such as laser rifles.
