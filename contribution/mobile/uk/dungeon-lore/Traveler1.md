[You pick up an extremely old piece of paper, it looks as though it was from an age long before data cataloguing was being researched]  
  
[You take a look at the piece of paper. It seems someone has hastily scribbled the word FINEL on it. Much of the ink and graphite marking has eroded away and are no longer legible. What piece and scraps you can make out are the words "traveler", "worldbreaker", and a few parse phrases that this "Finel" has traveled the world and its continent, often setting records and breaking traditions wherever he set foot.]  
  
[On the back of the scrap of paper, you make out what faintly resembles a statue of some sort, perhaps to commemorate the feat and accomplishments of this "Finel" person.]
