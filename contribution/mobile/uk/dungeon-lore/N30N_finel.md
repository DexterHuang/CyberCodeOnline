#### N30N C1RCUS: Str33t Angles

Wary of snipers, the four bodyguards hustled their client from the armoured SUV into the building and into the elevator. 

Two blocks away, Finel held his breath and gently squeezed the trigger. The round went through a broken pane in the warehouse window opposite, ricocheted at an weird angle off a steel plate and exited through another broken window, at 90 degrees to it's original direction. It ricocheted off another carefully angled plate in another derelict building and with the last of it's velocity, gracefully dolphined over the street to smack into a wall and bounce into a gutter. Which funnelled it into the breather pipe for the electrical room, down which it happily rattled to fall through a conveniently placed hole in the relay cabinet before finally came to rest - neatly bridging out the elevator safety circuit. 

The elevator reached the 16th floor and didn't stop. The bridged safety circuit let the motors pull it into the headgear and then rip the cables from their mountings. And the mechanical safety wedges that would ordinarily have stopped it falling more than a metre or two had been removed for 'routine maintenance'.

Finel heard the crash while packing away the last few bits and pieces. He thumbsed up without looking up and headed down to the street. Frank looked up as he quietly pushed through the door into Joe's, and slid a beer across the counter, grunting *"The AI said to put this on its tab"*.

*"DOGES runs a tab ??"*  
*"Any day now damn thing's going to in here crying into's pretzels on a Friday night like the rest of ya"*  
*"Huh! Uh ... pretzels .. ?"*
