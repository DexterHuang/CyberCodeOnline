`[Part 2 of 4]`

Sam can be seen peeking out of his apartment window, visibly sweating. His free hand is lightly shaking, as he uses his other hand to cover his eyes from the sun's blinding light. "Shit," he spurts out. "I really hope Dan can pull through. I can't spend the rest of my life like this." He quickly walks away from the window and paces back and forth across the room, muttering to himself. "What if he can't do anything? What if it's already too late and the Blitzers are on their way? What if..."

He stops for a moment. He looks back at the window, staring at it. He slowly approaches the window, looking out of it. He leans his head forward, noticing a strange van parked outside of his apartment. "I've never seen that van. I've... I've never seen that van. *I-I've never seen it before.* Oh god. They're here. I'm so screwed. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna be the next victim. ***Oh god no.***" He starts scrambling across his apartment, tripping over his coffee table and slams into his wall. He yelps in agony, holding his shoulder with his right arm. He slowly approaches the front door, hoping that the Blitzers aren't already on the other side.

He gets up to the door, keeping his head out of the peekhole. His breathing starts to get faster. He's holding his chest, and can feel his heart racing. He closes his eyes and takes on long, deep breath. "Well... if I'm going to die, I might as well face it." He takes a moment, then lunges his eye into the peekhole. Expecting an armed response, Sam is surprised at the usual nothingness on the other side. He collapses onto the floor, his breathing picking up yet again. He was safe, for the moment.

**That was, until the door suddenly broke open.**
