> #30780528 Phone Call Elin  
  
"Bebo, we sold to them." Elin was crying. She sat in her office and could hear her brother on the other line. They didn't talk like this In fact- she never called him. Even after she'd dropped her Mother off at home she'd just sent him a text. but she knew he'd want to know. "I checked the logs."  She said, sniffling, "When I looked into the camera- I saw them. Our own weapons. in their hands."  
  
"Calmate. Look I looked into it here as well. They have been buying for a while. Don't worry I set some guys up from WAP to guard the store. But honestly, every day the Mambas are stronger..." she could hear him thinking. She'd never approved of his Gangs, but now, well now she knew better. She knew what was hidden behind those gangs. It was all the same. Her company?  Same bullshit.  
  
Through her tears she prepared herself. She'd talked to Maggie and They'd come up with a plan. She'd gotten the number of a vendor- one of theirs. Together they'd pushed a proposal through. "Arasaka Community Restoration Project" the program aimed to invest in local communities. Investing in the community would let them sell weapons. And the first community they'd partnered with?  Market street.
