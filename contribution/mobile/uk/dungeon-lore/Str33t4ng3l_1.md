**Blonde-haired woman:** Hey, did you hear about the str33t4ng3ls are holding another charity event to raise money for the orphanage this saturday?  
  
**Woman with lipstick:** Oh, ya. It is the third charity drive they organized this month alone. This city has been blessed ever since the str33t4ng3ls formally became a charity organization and they have been all over the news.  
  
**Blonde-haired woman:** Maybe we should go and volunteer. Doesn't hurt to give back to the community once in a while. I have a girl-friend that's on the chair committee.  
  
**Woman with lipstick:** Definitely give them a call. I know my knitting circle has been trying to volunteer at one of those events. The Str33t4ng3ls always get so many helping hands that they have to turn people away. Who knew there were so many giving souls left in this city.
