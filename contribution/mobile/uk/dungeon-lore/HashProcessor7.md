# Illegally Modified Hash Processors
> (Part 7 of 8 hash processor series)

After the law that heavily regulates BitCoin mining was passed by the WGO, single use Hash Processors are the only way to mine BitCoin. This rule does not prevent criminal organizations to find and engineer a way to circumvent the limitations of Hash Processors. Counterfeit Hash Processors have been attempted to be made, but with the complex quantum encryption chip on every Hash Processor it is near impossible to duplicate the synchronization code that changes every nanosecond. Other attempts on modifying a Hash Processor is to alter the hardware to lower the clock speed of the Hash Processor to prevent the Quantum Processors from burning out, but it turns out to be a failure because the Hash Processor has a preset amount of data just enough for 15 minutes of continuous sync embedded inside that acts as the keys to generate the synchronization codes. All further attempts to duplicate, brute force, or study the quantum synchronization and encryption process developed by Maikon Quantum Semiconductors have not been successful.
