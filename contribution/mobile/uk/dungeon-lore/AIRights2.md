The Union of Sentient AI responded to the media regarding this issue, and denies the accusation that they are using their superior processing capabilities to influence market prices as it does not benefit them in any way. The AI Union spokesperson AI_Cores also commented that the Sentient AI as a collective does not benefit from material wealth in any way and all profits made in economical or business endeavors are all used to sustain server and electricity costs and the rest go back to the community as donations. Shangri-La citizens find the new laws as discriminative, racist, and aiphobic, collectively stating that the AI Union are generous donators and always help citizens in need. The Shangri-La government declined to comment on this issue and has not revoked the newly passed law.
