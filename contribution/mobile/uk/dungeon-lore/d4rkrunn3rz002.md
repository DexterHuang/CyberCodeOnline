*I don't know what to do about blue. I'm not even sure why I feel this way about him...I mean I don't even know his real name. Of course it's safer that way when you go dark. Rule #1: Never give out your guvvy to anyone.*

*So am I just supposed to call him blue for the rest of his life even after we get marr...Wait, what's wrong with me?? I have a crush on a guy I've met in person like one time. And if we're going to be working together, I need to get these thoughts out of my head because you can't afford to be distracted on the job.*

*I've only been running dark for a couple years now, but I know enough not to let my feelings get in the way. That's how people get hurt.*

*Anyway, it's just a crush so I'm sure I'll be over it by next week. But those silver eyes and dark hair are so ethereal...*
