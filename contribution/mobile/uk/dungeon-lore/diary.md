> *You find a series of what looks like diary entries on a ripped piece of paper.*

1-5: My daughter... My poor innocent young Eve. She didn't deserve it. I should have been there but my stupid flipping job forced me to be elsewhere, leaving my little  six year old daughter all alone for hours while I did idiotic and mind numbing work. I need to get stronger. I have to.

I went to Shangri-La. I heard that every person who wants to be strong has to start here. On that note, the implant everybody here seems to have seems to let me communicate with other people and create ammo and medicine. It's something I wish I had sooner. I noticed I had to give myself a new name for this new server for communications that seems to have automatically connected me to it now. It took me awhile to think about it before putting it in but I ended up choosing a great new name. My baby girl would have been proud.

1-6: With the help of my new server mates(?) (maybe friends?), I ended up getting physically strong pretty quickly. It does help that I kept going into several dungeons that help greatly with making me physically strong. These people are really friendly. One of them even given me items I wouldn't have ever been able to get without their help. Their kindness will never be forgotten... She would have loved them.

I've been greatly injured and almost at death's door in one of the oldest dungeons according to the older people who have practically taken me under their wing like I'm a kid, but right before my death, someone had taken me somewhere where it all began. They took some of my money. I'll get them for that... I tried to ask about this stranger to my friends yet it seems they don't know who brings them to the Center either. I should remember to be more careful next time. The stranger could be dangerous.
