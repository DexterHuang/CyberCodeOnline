>[Archived entry from a personal hospital terminal]  
  
I... I can't believe I got away from those crazy nut jobs. The last thing I remembered was my hand being cut off and tossed out into the street. Doc told me some random stranger brought me to the hospital but I think it's another ex-member that has been plotting to overthrow the whole insane organization. These.... New Age Enlightenment people are serious about what they preach; about sharing the bounty of "The Great Father Earth", that all are equal in his eyes.... until they themselves deem you not equal... something less than a human being. I didn't think they would take it so liter-ally. It was just a normal meeting, there was an exact number of refreshments set out, and I mean EXACT to the number of members attending checked at the door. I didn't think they would cut off my hand for taking one extra cup... but here I am, at the hospital. The Doc said they know someone from the body mod shop that can get me a new hand. I'm just grateful I am alive. I hope whoever helped me is ok too.
