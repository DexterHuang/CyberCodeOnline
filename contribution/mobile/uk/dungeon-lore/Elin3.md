Hey Abi, I am so sorry to bother you but I wanted to know if you could check why my time for the holidays wasn't approved?  
I've been working nonstop and was hoping after these reports were in that I could take a few days. I know it's a busy season but I was hoping to check!  
  
thanks,  
Elin

Hello Elin,  
As per our last email I regret to inform you that your time could not be approved. As for the reason your reports have been approved but are still in revision.  
As you well understand this is a busy time and perhaps after your Year end review you'll have some time to spare for a visit.  
  
I would like to remind you that the new Precision technology you are working on and reviewing is a top priority for Arasaka and cannot be left undone. You will have time once all this passes, as we all will.  
  
If you would like I can provide you with the name of a good Doctor that can provide you with performance enhancers for the long nights ahead.  
  
Best,  
Abi
