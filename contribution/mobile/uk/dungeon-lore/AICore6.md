# Auto Pilot for the Human Brain
> (Part 6 of 8 aicore series)

AICOREs are sophisticated self-aware technological marvels that enable the ability to use "autopilot" mode for your body. Not only can it automate repetitive and boring tasks, AICOREs can give your body skills you never had while your consciousness can finish jobs, learn new stuff, or even have fun playing games in virtual reality. By using AICOREs, someone who has never cooked even instant noodles can make a five-star gourmet dish by using an AICORE to automate the cooking; this also applies to other skills that require a lot of practice and experience. 

Usage of AICOREs are time-restricted to 2 hours per session to avoid the small chance of neural unlinking of the user's consciousness. Neural unlinking forces the user to do a neural cortex transfer and transfer to a new body, which is an inconvenience and an unnecessary cost. This phenomenon happens because the brain with only the AICORE consciousness within would slowly reject the original consciousness after detached for extended periods of time. Scientists have determined that 2 hours is the maximum safe time for continuous AICORE usage to automate tasks while the main consciousness is detached. 

There have been cases of very long activation of AICOREs without any rejection of the host mind, but those examples are mostly military personnel with specialized Cerebral Accelerators which ensure both the AICORE and the host are always present simultaneously, preventing any rejection reaction.
