# The Cyber Bars Around the World
> (part 8 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

Cyber Code Mercenaries, as their name implies, are a mercenary group; they will do the job as long as they get paid. Jobs handed out by the World Government Organization (WGO) are still top priority and must be prioritized over any of their current jobs. Even with how often new resistance groups emerge, the Cyber Code Mercenaries more often than not are just on standby, waiting for the next urgent job from the WGO. 

A high ranking CCM member codenamed Pikkon85 had an idea to build establishments called Cyber Bars that double as a place for Cyber Code Mercenaries to hang out when they are not on a mission, and also as an acting office building that is available to the public to post requests for the Mercenaries' help. The jobs posted by civilians range widelyâ€”from asking for help carrying or moving heavy items, to seeking hired bodyguards, to criminal activity reports. Jobs involving criminal activity do not require payment as they are paid for by the WGO. 

The Cyber Bars are also known as a place for civilians to have great drinks served by a specialized AI called Super Alcohol Mixologist Expert Komrade, or just SAMEK or Komrade for short. The SAMEK AI is able to mix any drink that exists in the world and also predict what drink a customer would enjoy the most. As soon as a new drink is invented, SAMEK instantly gets updated with the recipe.
