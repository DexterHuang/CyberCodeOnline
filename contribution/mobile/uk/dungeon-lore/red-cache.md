> You find an old recording drone with a cracked screen sitting on top of some rubble. After fiddling around with it for a while, the screen flickers to life. You swipe around, hoping to find useful info, but it looks like there's nothing except a video. Out of curiosity, you press play. 

It looks like there's a man with a large bag and a woman standing outside the outskirts of Shangri-La. You see the familiar neon freeways in the background, the sound of traffic blocking all other audio. The woman looks delighted by the view, but the man looks incredibly jittery, glancing into the drone camera every so often. Eventually, he takes her hand, and reaches into his bag. He gets down on one knee and pulls out a glowing red cache. The woman starts jumping up and down, nodding enthusiastically. The man pulls the woman off camera, and what looks like energy cells hit the drone. You hear some playful laughter, then the screen goes dark.

> You shake the drone, hoping it'll come back to life, but to no avail. You put the drone back down onto the rubble. You walk away, feeling a little more warm hearted than usual. Maybe one day, you'll find a special person to give a red cache to too.
