> **The Fad3dW0rld Virus Incident**

An experimental military cybernetic virus code name "Fad3dW0rld" developed to disorient the enemy, and improve physical camouflage garment efficiency was stolen by a terrorist hacker group NeuR0sis. 

The terrorists uploaded a modified global base cybernetic firmware update that contains the virus into the central cloud update server, causing people who are awake with automatic firmware updates enabled to experience their cerebral implants go haywire causing them to forget their name and become colorblind. People who were asleep did not get infected by the virus because cloud sync ports are automatically turned off to reduce synaptic activity when asleep. 

An emergency cybernetic software update was  issued shortly after to cure the cybernetic virus with no lasting ill effects to the victims of this incident. Military officials have declined media inquiries about the incident while the terrorist group claims the military is developing far more malicious cybernetic viruses, suggesting some can even cause the brain to instantly shutdown leading to permanent death, preventing any cortex transfer resuscitation.

The hacker group gave a warning to citizens of Shangri-La to boycott the military and protest against cybernetic weapons of mass destruction that one day may kill millions of innocent people in one of their recent VirtuBlogâ„¢ Holovid.
