# Declassification of the Cyber Code Project
> (part 2 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

The Cyber Code Project was a secret military project that started in 24th August 2051 to push the limits of both physical and mental capabilities of a human and create a super soldier. Information of this project was finally declassified on 11th March 2067 when the World Government Organization declared Cyber Code Mercenaries as the official elite military unit for peacekeeping, crime fighting, and military prowess. This project was led by a special secret service agent under the code name Dexter H. or publically known as the superstar Epic Dexter. The methods of this project were often viewed as unethical as failed experiment subjects were left with major physical trauma, broken bones, and even irreparable brain damage. Ethical concerns about this project were divided because the subjects used in the experiment were deathrow inmates that were slated for execution. Some people support the act of experimenting on deathrow criminals as they deserve the pain and torture while the others say that they are still human and deserve a quick, painless, and humane death.
