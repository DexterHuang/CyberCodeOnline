# Fighting Crimes and Peace Keeping
> (part 11 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

When on active duty most Cyber Code Mercenaries hang out in Cyber Bar establishments spread around the whole world. Some of them just get drunk and chat with each other in the Cyber Bar, while the rest takes on minor jobs from citizens in need and fight against criminals that are cybernetically enhanced with illegal bionics and implants. The regular police would just get needlessly killed if they try to combat such criminals. The other Cyber Code Mercenaries who are not actively working as special law enforcement units do miscellaneous jobs requested in the Cyber Bar. The jobs posted by civilians vary from helping a construction project utilizing their superhuman strength, helping process scientific data utilizing their super fast Cerebral Accelerator implants. Some post jobs for them to act as bodyguards when passing through dangerous conflict regions, while some post simple normal jobs such as rescuing their stuck cat. The Cyber Bar acts like a police station, military garrison, fire department, search and rescue, and emergency response all in one place. They also often help with emergencies such as saving people in a building fire, helping with natural disasters, or traffic accidents.
