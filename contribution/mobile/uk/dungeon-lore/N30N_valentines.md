#### N30N C1RCUS: Lovin' On The Edge

She led him down the alley and ducked through a hole in the junkyard fence. 

*"Uh .. isn't this the Karamazov's place? Don't they have like mutant killer attack dogs?"*  
*"They're augmented, not mutants!"*

She scrambled lithely over the piles of scrap and began to climb the tall derelict crane that loomed skeletally against the evening sky. Stepping out onto the boom he tried not to look down but vertigo kicked in viciously anyway and he gritted his teeth and suppressed a whimper as he followed her out to where she was perched happily on the end.

The setting sun caught her elfin face in profile and it suddenly dawned:

*"Wait a sec .. you're l33t's little sister??"*  
*"Uh huh"*  
*"Oh god!! I'm dead!"*  

She leaned in and murmured:

*"Mmmmmm! She'll probably give you a 100m running start though. She's nice that way."*

Then she reached up and kissed him and it felt like the earth moved but really it was just the crane swaying in the breeze.
