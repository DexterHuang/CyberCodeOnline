*STATIC*


>A large man with a neckbeard, ponytail, augmented reality headset and poorly fitted Sword Art Online T-shirt enters the frame sporting a cheeto encrusted Legendary Astral Decimation Cannon. He appears to be pointing the weapon at a figure in the distance. 


*EXPLOSIONS*


Wow omg guys! This really blew up!! 


>The man with the cannon, who you now have identified as a Crusty Redditor skips with glee over to what's left of the figure in the distance. The Redidtor rummages through the tattered remains and then picks up a couple of lightly singed Hash Processors.


Thanks for the gold kind Stranger!!

>You rip the drive out of the display and throw it to the ground. It's time to move on.
