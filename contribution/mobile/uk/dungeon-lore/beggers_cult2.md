### 7 Commandments of Beggars Cult

1. You have the freedom to worship other Gods but we should still respect our God of Beggars.

2. Beg moderately don't push others to give you something and don't annoy the Rich humans.

3. If you receive something be thankful and ask the God of Beggars to bless them with Beggars Luck.

4. We fellow beggars should love and respect each other. If we can or we have the abilities to help, then help our fellow beggars.

5. We don't have a leader, we are all equal.

6. We are martyrs, we ignore and respect the Rich even though they discriminate against us. Also, we should pray for their forgiveness to our God of Beggars to soften their hearts to change their evil ways.

7. There are still other cults who have different views but still we should respect them and if possible we should make them our friends if they are interested but don't push them.
