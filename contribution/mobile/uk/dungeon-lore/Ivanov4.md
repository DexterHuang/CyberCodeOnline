Mission in Shangri-La Business District is taking a turn. Our hopes at the beginning were limited force and no civilian casualties. That no longer seems possible.  
  
The Followers are getting reinforcements from the outer settlements and tensions are running higher every day. The companies who hired us are putting more and more pressure on us, turns out revolution is bad for business. We can only do so much without devolving into an all-out war. None of us want that. We have family out there. I have family out there.  
  
Z-Corp has been working on some sort of medical type weapon. They claim it just sedates the enemy and makes them easy to apprehend without the use of force. I don't buy it. There's something else going on here. I'm no scientist but I know something shifty when I see it. They said it'll be ready in a matter of weeks. Seems they've been preparing for this for a good while. No wonder The Followers and all those scavs don't trust them.  
  
My favourite food truck stopped serving us military folks. Said they couldn't support the threat of violence in their community. Real principled lady. You gotta respect it on some level. Honestly, those noodles were so good I hope this all blows over just so I can grab another bowl.  
  
We all just wanna go back to normal now. I wanna go home.  
  
Signing off.
