People unobtrusively made way for her as she sashayed down the street. It was a good sashay she thought, the kind that separated the girls from the boys, and there was just time for a quick one at Joe's. The rube who was about to whistle his appreciation went white as his buddy kicked his shin - **hard** - and whispered a warning.  
  
_"Sheesh, Frank .. what does a girl have to do to get disrespected around here?"_ she grinned at the bartender.  
  
_"Might be all that ironmongery you're carrying hon'"_ he grinned back.  
  
_"What?!? This lil' ol' thing here? It isn't even loaded"_ she said, placing the somewhat ornate but nonetheless pretty Amnesia MkIII laser on the bar top.  
  
He laughed: _"That one might not be! All the rest definitely are .. your usual?"_.  
  
She sipped her drink until it was time and then left quietly. Outside, she slipped into the shadows, moving economically. Biz time.  
  
Inside, a guy at the other end of the bar asked wonderingly: _"Uh, was that l33t4ng3l?"_  
  
_"Yup. You met the 4ng3l!"_ said Frank. _"And lived to tell your friends!"_ he lied, sliding a rohypnol laced beer across the counter. One question too many.
