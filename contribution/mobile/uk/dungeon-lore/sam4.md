`[Part 4 of 4]`

> As you press start on the recording, you get an ear-full of horrible microphone-chip static. You cover your ears as you hear ringing for the next few minutes, then finally uncover them and restart the recording, notably skipping the first few seconds.

> You then hear talking, and listen in.

Sam: Please, I'm so sorry, I didn't know she was with yo-
Unknown Blitzer: Shut the fuck up, you disrespectful pig. Yous gonna show plenty of forgiveness to the boss when he uses you as his personal punching bag.
Sam: No... Please, it doesn't have to be like this...
Unknown Blitzer: Oh, it can be like this, alright. Hell, I like it like this. Y'know why? 'Cause I get to beat the shit outta pretty boys like you. See this arm? I got it modified. Pure steel. Hits like a fuckin' truck, I tell you. And I love to see pretty boys get their faces all screwed up an' ugly.
Sam: *sobbing*

> A loud **BONK** can be heard, as Sam's crying quickly turns to coughing.

Unknown Blitzer: **YEAH, HOW'S THAT, PRETTY BOY? YOU WANT SOME MORE?**

> Another **BONK** is heard, and Sam's coughing gets worse.

Unknown Blitzer: Hah... I think that's enough. The boss should get to use you, not me. But boy, do I love to rough you fucks up.
