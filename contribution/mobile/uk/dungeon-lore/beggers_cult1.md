### Beggars Cult

When the civilization turns against the past and surges, the futuristic logic turns the world upside down. One old man became a beggar, who was called by the name “Fragile Old Man”. This old fellow faces full discrimination in a futuristic world and witness how humans became heartless cold-blooded mortals who take pride in their immoral lifestyles. The only thing that makes him humble is his useless status in society.  

One trashy day in his life as a beggar, some disrespectful teenager hit him with a baseball bat without reason and fled while laughing gleefully. The beggar lost consciousness and his world became void. The void's screaming silence makes the old man want to give up his precious life. But just as nothing was making sense, there was a small orb of light that became bigger and bigger. The void became so bright that it felt like a miniature star.  

The bright object made the old man feel warm and reminded him of his mother's affectionate cuddles. The bright orb spoke.  

"Beggar, I pity you deeply. Even the world has turned against you, you still believe in humanity. I am not strong enough to change the world but I can warm their hearts. You and other people who give in to the real righteousness of the mortal world will be blessed with heavenly defying luck. I wish you a long and fulfilling life. Goodbye"   

The fragile old man woke up screaming and crying for the things he visioned. This is when the Beggars Cult was born.
