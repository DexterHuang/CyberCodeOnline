# Breaking the Barrier of Human Multitasking
> (Part 7 of 8 aicore series)

For a long time it has been a well-accepted scientific fact that the human brain is, by design, not capable of multitasking. This notion was proven false when the first Cerebral Accelerator implant was invented. By having a Cerebral Accelerator implant, humans can speed up their thought processes and even install auxiliary AI entities or personalities called AICORE. Using an AICORE, the brain can utilize the processing power of the AI entity to do multiple tasks at the same time, or even delegate partial or full control of the body. Civilian AICORE only allow one module to be installed and active at any single time, with an activation time limit of 2 hours. The time limitation is there to prevent any side effects from detaching the host's mind from the brain for extended periods of time which may cause rejection of the consciousness. 

Despite the risks, military trials have tested successfully up to 8 AICORE running at the same time inside the Cerebral Accelerator, allowing the subject to fully control an experimental Mech Suit that has 32 times the movement and reaction speed of a conventional one without any external help. This feat is only possible with very specific training for the neural load and specialized modified Cerebral Accelerators.
