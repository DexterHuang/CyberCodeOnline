[Children of Enlightenment Datalogue NO.3098]  
  
>Private Entry Log  
  
>"We held the usual meeting at the Enlightenment Centre today. However, once again the number of attending members dwindled again. On a normal day this would not have been an overt concern, as we can always go out to the street and recruit more. Some of our more..... upper echelon members and leaders were not present for the meeting. Rumors through the mountain valley is that one of the initiates heard from a SLPD officer that they were responding to a disturbance that was supposedly caused by some members from the Children of the Enlightenment, but when they arrived at location, according to the reports, they found our members.... feeding on a body. Disturbing rumors indeed, though we are not exactly trusting with local authorities.
