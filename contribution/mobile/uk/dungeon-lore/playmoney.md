> A bank note. At least, that's what you think it is. It's not any bank notes you seen in the 
Librarium archive. It has a little man on it, upon closer inspection. A little man with a
moustache, top hat and holding a cane. You think back to the librarium archive, maybe one 
of the record entries mentioned a game of some sort with fake, play money.
