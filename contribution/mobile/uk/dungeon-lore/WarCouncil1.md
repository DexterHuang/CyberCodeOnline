**Gruff Man's Voice:** I don't appreciate your officers running amok in the streets, Evan.  
  
**Evan:** I don't quite understand your complaint here. I AM the police captain.  
  
**Gruff Man's Voice:** I know who you are, Evan. I goddamn got you your office. I help you win the election with the department of justice and the Chief of Police.  
  
**Evan:** I don't think you quite understand the power structure here. I AM the police and you are a private citizen. I can put whatever charges I want on you and there would be nothing you can do.  
  
**Gruff Man's Voice:** Not if me and my Warcouncil has anything to say. Even if I am gone, my son Worzel will take over and see to it that you are thrown out to the street.  
  
**Evan:** (Clearly irritated) We will see about that, won't we? I think it's time that you leave the station. This conversation never happened.
