Sir,

Recently, our subjects of The Memory have started developing psychotic behavioral patterns. I've lost a staff member to this pandemic of instability. With all due respect, I'm shutting down The Memory and rebooting The Crucible. Our best bet is to reset their minds and hope to whatever that the damage isn't permanent.

On this note, I'm releasing to you the project files associated with the subjects on next transmission. Await further details.
