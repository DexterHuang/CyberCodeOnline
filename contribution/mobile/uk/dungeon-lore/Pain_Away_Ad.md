![Pain Away ad](/resources/lore/pain%20away%20ad%20on%20wall.png)

You come across an ad for Pain Away plastered on a nearby wall. Why would Medikama even need to run an ad campaign for Pain Away? The stuff's absolutely ubiquitous. Hell, you've stumbled across a fair number of crates full of Pain Away in just the past few minutes. Although, judging by the hellish wall-to-wall advertising the citizens of Shangri-La are subjected to day in and day out, ads must be absurdly cheap. 

Strange, though, to see a physical ad this far out of the way. Who would even bother coming here to advertise?
