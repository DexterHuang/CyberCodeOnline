>[ Chapter one: The untapped potential ]

You find a torn backpack sitting on the floor. Several dried blood spots can be seen on the sides of it. You tried to lift it but, the backpack itself seems to be heavy. You are curious.
*"What's inside?"*
To find the answer, you slowly start to unzip it....
A strong odor hits your nose without short notice and causes you nausea.
*"Oh dear lord! That is so.. (vomits).. bad!"*
You close your nose with one hand and open the backpack with the other. It seems like some kind of glass jar is inside. You can feel the coldness from the touch.
*"I wish it has something rare or legendary."*
You cross your fingers and pull out the jar. It is a freaking human brain floating in formalin liquid. You also find some liquid leaking from a small crack on the bottom of the jar, which causes that intolerable odor. You take a nice closer look at it. Looks like the brain has some implants across its cerebellum and cortex. From your knowledge with upgrade modules, it seems like the brain was tested the potential of telekinesis. 
*"Telekinesis? Damn, I could use some of that to throw people left and right. But why is this here? Whose brain is this?"*
You carefully put back the glass jar inside the torn backpack and move away.
