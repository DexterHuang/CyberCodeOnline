>Upon entering the room, a huge shadow cast in the corner of the room makes you wonder what could possibly be over there. Your sense of discovery brings you closer to the object without you realizing it.  
  
>A metallic box. A weird box with a weird weight to it. You shake it. Clearly something is inside, tumbling around. You take a good look at it with what dim light you could find. A once bright yellow color has long faded to a more muted shade. The "?" symbol etched on the four sides of the box felt smooth now, corroded by the rough ground and wind over a long period of time. You shook the box again, this time with no echo tumbling inside. Out of curiosity, you punch the box. A puff of dust and musty smell greets you rudely.  
  
>You toss the box back on the ground, wheezing from the dust. You leave it there for someone else to ponder over the enigmatic nature of the box.
