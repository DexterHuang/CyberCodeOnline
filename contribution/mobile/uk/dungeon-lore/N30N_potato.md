#### N30N C1RCUS: No Tuba For The Tuber

The short figure hurried between shadows, making it's way down to the seedier - if there could be said to be such a thing - end of CCO, where the less expensive warehouses were located. _PotatoMan_ was nervous - not unusual for him really - but in this specific case he'd had to leave town in a hurry when the bottom dropped out of the meds market and he owed a lot of people a lot of money. Not the understanding kind of people either. But there was a stash of AI and hash and he couldn't leave it behind and if he was very careful and very quick - and a little bit lucky - nobody would even know he'd been back.

Down the alley a trashcan lid crashed to the ground, making him jump. Cat probably. He hoped it wasn't one of Kate's. And then his heart fell - on a crate across another cat was self-absorbedly washing itself and looking at him. One of Kate's. Sh*t! He didn't have much time..

Darting forward he stepped in something .. **nasty** and involuntarily looked down. So he completely didn't see the very large and extremely heavy crate that dropped accurately out of the evening sky.

_"Oh, well aimed!"_ said an entirely fake British voice from a nearby rooftop.  
_"Danken! It is mein expertise, ja?"_ replied a guttural voice from above. And then observed: _"Er ist eine Kartoffelp√ºree, ja?"_.  
_"Ha! Ha! Very good! Well, be seeing you!"_, the voice and it's ersatz owner faded into the night.  

Further down the street other shadows moved quietly away - the price on _PotatoMan_ had been .. enticing.
