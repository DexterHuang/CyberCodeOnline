#### N30N C1RCUS: Princess9 Be Rappin'

 They say go to Shangri-La,  
 And I said nah, 
 Don't got no time for that.  
 But I did and I say what I saw:

 All my skills are at cap,  
 All I'm printing is ****.  
 It's back to the train, got baddies to maim  
 No time  
 To be using my brain.  
    
 I'm rolling in trash cache 
 Cuz I ain't got no hash cash.  
    
 And I know you're sayin' 
 That I should just keep on playin'.  
 I'm low level I know,  
 I started off slow but check out my gear,  
 I'm getting my flow.  
 It's all thanks to the C1RCUS, the N30N, the glow.
