>Something colorful and small in a bag demands your attention. You walk up to the bag without a second thought.  
  
>A bunch of empty medicine capsules. One red, one blue, and one yellow, to be precise. You are not sure what this bag of empty pill capsules is doing here, maybe someone dropped it in a hurry, after medicating themselve. You take a closer look at these capsules, each the same but slightly different, almost as if they were made specifically to combat a certain kind of illness. You have a momentary thought about taking these with you, but you thought better of it.  
  
>You leave the empty pill capsules back on the ground where you found them, for someone else to marvel at their bright color.
