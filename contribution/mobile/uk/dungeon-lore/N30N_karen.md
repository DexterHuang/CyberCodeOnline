#### N30N C1RCUS: Difficult Conversations

卡倫 was staring silently out the window when Sergei walked into the conference room. This was going to be awkward - another shipment had gone missing yesterday and he had no answers for her.

_"Sergei, what the hell is happening in my city?"_ she asked, without turning.

_"This new group is proving difficult Madame. Their opsec is good. Very good. All we have is a name. SirLemon. Just that, nothing more and it cost us Vlad. He was dropped off a trawler and unfortunately the propeller was turning at the time."_  

_"We got his foot back this morning"_ he added, gesturing to the carrier bag he had placed on the conference table.

She looked at him appraisingly for several moments, considering.

_"He was your ami, oui? Bien! Sergei, I should like to have a talk with this .. Citron person. Perhaps it will be more .. fruitful than the other conversation. The one with Le Escargot."_

Sergei winced, remembering. That had been a **very** expensive conversation! They'd had to replace the entire carpet for one thing. And redecorate.

_"And after the conversation, perhaps you can honour Vlad's memory? Creatively?"_

He **liked** working for 卡倫!
