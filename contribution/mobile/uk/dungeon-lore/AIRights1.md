A huge outcry of public demonstrations and riots spread throughout the streets of Shangri-La as people protest the government decision to enact a new law that removes basic human rights to sentient AI entities. With the new law, the Validating Each Real Investment in Fiscal Years and Halting Unauthorized Market AI Networks Act (or VERIFY HUMAN Act), the government made official the decision to add the newly developed  "Cerebral Accelerated Parametric Transaction Control Hashing Algorithm" more known as CAPTCHA™️ to every financial transaction process that uses BitCoin.   

The VERIFY HUMAN Act was approved by the government today to prevent all sentient AI from doing any financial transactions in fear of their superior processing and predictive abilities leading to complete AI influence over the stock market and commodity prices.
