#### N30N C1RCUS: Once Upon A Time In A Pachinko Palace  
  
The door to _Pete's_ jangled as she hip bumped through it, Rena looking up from behind the counter.  
  
_"Hey, 's happening?"_  
_"Not much, just the tall slab of misery at the end. Might get busier later though"_  
  
She glanced down towards where the single customer was oblivious to anything other than the bells and flippers of their ancient and only pachinko table. Kinda cute. Rena was laughing at her:  
  
_"Rule #1, do not do the clientele"_  
_".. on the pachinko table"_ she chimed in with a grin. Rena picked up her stuff and swung out the door:  
_"Outta here"_  
_"Later"_  
  
She curled up on the still warm chair with a latte and buried herself in Anna's so-complicated entanglements, glancing down every so often to check on their one customer. Moscow 1876 sounded pretty different to CCO - fur hats for one thing - the guy was actually pretty cute.  
  
A cheerful whistle sounded from outside and she looked up as _cutie-at-the-end_ finished his game, picked up his jacket and headed out past her.  
  
Best bright smile: _"Hey"_  
Startled half-smile back: _"Hey"_  
  
Great. A whole conversation. From outside she heard:  
  
_"Spud!"_  
_"Tripp"_  
  
She half-listened as they moved away, rabbiting on about crits and BTC. Boy talk. 15 pages later she sighed, put the book down, because clearly Anna was not going to jump Alexei any time soon, and wandered down to reset the machine.  
  
Out of habit she glanced at the score list. 'TRPPLHLX'. Dude seemed to be a bit shy around vowels and girls. And then narrowed her eyes at the actual score. Vowels or no vowels, the guy must have the reflexes of a cat. _"Bet I could make him purr like one too"_ she giggled.  
  
She gave the machine a wipe and went back to snow falling in Moscow. Maybe he'd be back. Maybe he wouldn't.
