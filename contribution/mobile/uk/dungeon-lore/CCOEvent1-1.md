# First Cyber Code Mercenary Joint Exercise
> (CCO Event #1 : Resilience)

Normally Cyber Code Mercenaries operate in small groups called gangs which means they rarely work with other groups. Being organized in small groups has the benefit of rapid response and deployment whenever a deployment command is received. Sometimes however a bigger force is needed to combat escalated conflicts. Most of the veterans come from military service thus they are used to large scale deployments, but the new recruits have no experience of working together in a large unit. A joint mission was assigned to the Cyber Code Mercenaries to do an operation on 1st May 2077 at 20:00 sharp universal time. The task is for all new recruits under 3 years of service to clean up small pockets of rebel forces spread around the world. By using overwhelming forces, the mission can be completed swiftly. Each team is assigned 9 random members and tasked to take out enemy forces in the fastest time possible. The team with the fastest mission completion time gets awarded with extra supplies for their next deployment.
