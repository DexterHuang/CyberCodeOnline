> You find a small, unmarked black cube on the ground. Picking it up, you notice a thin break across the middle. You twist it and a voice recording plays:

"We here at ***[Distortion]*** welcome you to the first rank of ***[Distortion]***. We look forward to working with you and wish you grand luck in the upcoming ***[Distortion]***. If you require any assistance, do not be afraid to locate us at the nearest ***[Distortion]***"

> The recording ends with a click and the box returns to its original state. You return it to the ground and keep walking.
