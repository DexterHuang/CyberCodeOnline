Even thought the Hyper Train was originally planned for continental travel with additional modification being fabricated for it and in the works of being fitted on the main rail fleet, production ceased abruptly when the funds for the project vanished up in smoke due to scandal surrounding the mayor and the corporation funding the project. To add to the chaos, although Energy cells were plenty and abundant, Motor-rail spec'd variety was high in demand with the rapid modernization of travel and the supply was running low with specialized research and production facilities coming to a near halt. The small numbers that weâ€™ve been producing and are available were being weaponized or sold at a high price. As it stands right now, the only small number of Hyper Trains in service does not have the necessary Energy Cell Capacitors for world-wide and international travel beyond the local areas surrounding Shangri-La City and its compassing borders.
