> #30780317 Phone Call Elin

"Bebo what do you mean she's hurt?" She was practically screaming at her brother. It had been almost a year since they'd last talked, and they had screamed last time, too.  
  
She could tell he was trying to be restrained as he spoke to her.  
  
"Look, Elin, a fight broke out in the street out front, it's not too bad but she got hurt by some of the gunfight." 
  
Elin took a moment. She counted down from five to calm herself as a million questions span in her head.  
  
"What the fuck happened?"  
  
His voice quieted. "There's a turf war, some guys found a rival gang out front. We're in the lower Hospital now."  
  
Elin began to make calculations in her head. A trauma team would be too aggressive, but her company had a medic team that could get it done.  
  
"I'll send a medic team to get her." She wasn't going to budge on this.  
  
"Elin, no I won't have any corpo shit here!"  
  
Elin had known her brother would protest, but she also knew their love for their mother would win in the end.  
  
"Goddammit, Bebo, we can't do this right now. I want her to have the best."  
  
"And what? the best is your money? You can't throw money at everything Elin- You haven't even visited in months! And what you wanna swoop in now? " 
  
Elin could hear the hate in his words, but she stopped herself again "Bebo, they're on their way. I love her as much as you do. Let. Me. Do. This."  
  
"Fine."
