#### N30N C1RCUS: The Brothers Karamazov

The man being none too gently shepherded into the workshop was pale and sweating. A financial executive, he was more accustomed to client discussions from behind a large - and, it has to be said, very nice - desk. The workshop smelled of ozone, oil and sweat and it wasn't really his milieu.

*"Look Craig, I'm sure there's been a misunderstanding. Can we talk this over, man to man, as civilized human beings.."*  
*"Greg, no' Craig"* grunted the large shaven headed man as he stapled the executive's hand to the workbench with an industrial stapler. 

The executive passed out. When he came to, his legs were taped to a chair and a large shaven headed man was perched on the workbench, sharpening what looked to be a very experienced fireman's axe. He tried again:

*"Uh huh, and that gets me into a nice set of dummy accounts and Craig and Greg will be waking up in ten minutes. PIN?"*  

*"68X53#7p"*  

Tap,tap,tap..

*"Ah, yes, better, thank you"*  
*"Good, can we go now?"*  
*"We? Who said anything about 'we'? But old Mrs Leibowitz said to give you this.."*  

A hand reached past him and placed a wood saw next to his free hand.
