"A very brief lesson on the history of Cybernetics, Bionics, and Implants, sponsored by Maikon."

"Part 1:  
In the year 2055, Maikon Quantum Semiconductors began producing high-grade Cybernetic Cerebral Enhancement technology for the Japanese military to improve soldier effectiveness in the field. In 2057, Maikon's research division partnered with the military to begin development of AICOREs, advanced AI that would reduce the number of pilots needed for a Mecha Suit from 2 to just 1. AICORE technology rapidly proved useful in a number of ways beyond Mecha Suit piloting - including giving soldiers the ability to gain combat skill proficiency with no prior training. 

Experiments with bionic limbs began finding new success with the advent of Cerebral Accelerators. This new research, combined with the advantages afforded by AICOREs, proved so effective that by 2062, military special forces and front line infantry were improved to run faster, hit harder, and have 3 times their normal stamina. When the World Government Organization was formed in 2066, they instantly pushed for civilian use of AICOREs and Cerebral Accelerators. By 2068, the WGO approved pop-up Maikon facilities to begin dispensing Maikon Implants at extremely reasonable prices."
