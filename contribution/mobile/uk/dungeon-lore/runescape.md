>Slightly cold from the dungeon, you try to find something to set on fire in an attempt to get warmed up. A sound looking board catches your attention.  
  
>You find a lone moldy wooden board in the middle of the room. It's not attached to anything, not to a post, or a skeleton. You walk up to it and pick it up. Moss and mildew covered the eroded board, with some faint writing: "Looking to buy GF, 100000G". You are not sure what it meant, or what it could possibly be referencing. You look around the wooden board. You find a cape with a symbol of what looks like a tree. You wonder why anyone would want to wear a cape with a tree on it for any reason.  
  
>You leave the wooden board and the cape where you found them. Maybe the next person can figure out what connection these two objects have.
