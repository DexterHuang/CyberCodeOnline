>Closing the door behind you as you enter this new room, a pool of prismatic light lures in your sense of wonderment. You walk towards the pool of light, trying to catch it.  
  
>What you find is a pile of oddly shaped crystals. You take a look around. You wonder if someone left them here on purpose. You pick one up and hold it to what little light there is. Nothing spectacular upon first impression. In fact, not much of an impression at all. The only thing that was remarkable about these crystals is the fact that they came in a multitude of colors. Faded with age beside, you can make out a few distinctive colors: red, white, green, purple, even a blue one. They are still shiny despite being left to the element for a long time. Setting aside the fact that they are a bit cracked and a tad dulled, they held their state pretty well, you remark.  
  
>You leave the pile of crystal where it is, leaving them for the next person to appreciate their timeworn, but ageless, beauty.
