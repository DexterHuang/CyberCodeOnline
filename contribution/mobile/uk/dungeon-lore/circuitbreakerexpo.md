**VENDOR ANNOUNCEMENT:** Asimov Automata and PKDroid will both be joining this year's lineup!

These tech giants both gained a foothold in the industry with their purpose-built SAMEK housings. They've both since branched out to a multitude of other designs and products, and their latest offerings will be on display at their booths in the main hall. But we'll also be seeing them both return to their roots... *on the SAMEK Strip!*

## ***The SAMEK Strip returns!***
You read that right - we're bringing back the SAMEK Strip! You'll be able to grab a drink and watch demonstrations by a variety of SAMEK units, from Asimov and PKD's newest models to some of this sector's scrappiest repurposed and custom-built models from our featured hobbyists! Hang around a bit longer, and you can even catch one of the head-to-head mixology battles (schedule TBA)!

You don't want to miss this!
