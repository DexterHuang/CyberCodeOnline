# Please read before submitting a new file

When you have finished your lore entry. Please run it through a spell checker. The easiest way to do this is to go to https://docs.new and paste the entry into a new document. It will then highlight any corrections.

Always click the 'Preview' tab to make sure your entry looks correct. If you need a new line, then you need to add a double space to the end of your sentence / paragraph.

If you would like to use more advanced formatting then please take a look at https://stackedit.io/app# which will make this easier.

You do not need to make your lines fit to the screen manually. The page will do that itself, make sure that 'Soft Wrap' is selected in the top right option box.

# Using the CCO Lore Wiki

-   Make sure to check out the CCO Lore Wiki at https://cyberwi.red/wiki!
-   You can reference the wiki to help you come up with ideas to add to notes.
-   **Checking the Lore Wiki before you submit your note** helps ensure that any dates or events you mention make sense in the timeline.
-   You can also freely add to the wiki to help flesh out the world of the game. For example:
    -   Your note might mention a company by name, and you (and others) can use the wiki to contribute more in-depth information about the company's history, activities, etc.
    -   That way, notes can be short, but there is still a way for readers to find out more.
-   For help with the Wiki, or if you want to be part of a group of lore writers who work together, send an [in-game message to Kimi Leta](https://cybercodeonline.com/player?playerName=Kimi%20Leta)
