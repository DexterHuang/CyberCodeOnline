# Overclocking the Human Brain to the Limit
> (part 4 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

Failed experiments regarding brain acceleration had very bad outcomes. Failed subjects were left with irreparable brain damage, and some even entered deep comas from which they never recovered. 

The first successful Cerebral Acceleration was achieved with the aid of a prototype neural implant based on the code from the illegal Neuralink application BB2039.nrl,  more commonly known as BrainBurst 2039. A modified version of this application allowed the brain to process information up to 1024 times faster, which subjectively causes the world to freeze. Having 1024 times the brain processing speed, however, does not mean that the subject can move their body any faster than humanly possible; this gave subjects the illusion of their body and the world moving in slow motion. To enable the subject to still move at normal speed while the world subjectively stays still in their point of view, they need bionic enhancements that could multiply their strength and reaction speed to match their accelerated brain processing speed.
