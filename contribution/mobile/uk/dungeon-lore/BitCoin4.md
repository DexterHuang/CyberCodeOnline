# BitCoin Adoption as the New Official Global Currency
> (Part 4 of 4 bitcoin series)

In 2071, the World Government Organization (WGO) declared that BitCoin would be adopted as the primary global currency. The value of BitCoin is fixed globally removing any need for Foreign Exchange (Forex) currency conversions. This adoption ensures a secure currency that cannot tampered, manipulated, or devalued by any governing entity or individual. Historically, there could only be 21 million BitCoins in circulation, but the WGO decided that each BitCoin would be split into 10 billion pieces with each piece having the value of 1 US Dollar.
