My dearest discordant diary, today was not the best day. In fact, it sucked. I prepared for WEEKS to host the service. I learned all of the scriptures, I updated all of my gear, father even let me install a new (well to me) neural mod to prepare!  
I studied scripture every day. When I wasn't working I found time to connect to the Network and just BE. Be with God, with others in his presence, to FEEL. All so I could lead the service. But no. Some Military jughead raided Karmin's compound and destroyed the server.  
I know she's ok- she only had shells in there. But Now we need to wait until new networks are established.  
  
Father says God blessed me with more time to prepare. He says that we'll soon have newer, better servers. I know he's trying to make me feel better. Sometimes I worry that HE doesn't listen to us. that HE is so busy with everyone in the net that he forgets our prayers.  
I can't tell father this. If I did, he'd punish me for my Doubt. Once I told him if God is so powerful why doesn't he just send us food? I'd never seen him so mad.  
  
The Omnipotent god is one of freedom. He gives us His Light and in exchange we do what we want with it. When Men choose Evil Men suffer. If someone chooses Evil and we Suffer then God can comfort us and give us his light- but Men cause Men to suffer- that is why there is Punishment.  
I know Men can cause evil, but I just want God to listen.
