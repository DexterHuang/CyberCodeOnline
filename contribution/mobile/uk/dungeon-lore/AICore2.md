# The Brain-Computer Interface Perfected
> (Part 2 of 8 aicore series)

A brain–computer interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device. BCIs are often directed at researching, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions. 

Historically, early BCIs were very limited in function; most often, they could only *read* brain activity with no way to send input directly. This was the case until a breakthrough was made in 2047, when a fully digitized simulation of the human brain was finally completed, boosting progress to research on how the brain works. The first Cybernetic Cerebral Enhancement (CCE) prototype was made in 2050 by a researcher at Shangri-La BioTech. After rigorous safety testing—and a lot of controversy—the first consumer CCE was finally available by 2054. 

This marked the dawn of the era where our brains could communicate directly with digital devices. Now, CCE implants are an inseparable part of us; current data suggests 94% of the human populace now has a CCE in their brain, with the other 6% comprising mostly indigenous tribes and minority purist groups that are against having any sort of mechanical or cybernetic enchancements.
