>You catch a small, faint glint out of the corner of your eye just as you were about to leave the room. Curious, you turn back to take a closer look.  
  
> You find a half empty vial of water sitting in the middle of the room. You wonder if someone got thirsty but not thirsty enough to drink the whole bottle. Upon closer inspection, the vial is made of glass, scratched and cracked in a few places. You swoosh the liquid inside the vial a bit. From what you can tell at least, looking at it in the dim light and with your naked eyeball, the liquid is just a tad thicker than water. You take the glass stopper off of the vial and take a whiff. The strong smelling liquid, despite being old, burnt your nose. You thought about touching it but thought twice about it. Just for fun, you chucked the whole concoction against the wall, shattering the glass vial and emitting a brief but bright blue flame. You failed to notice that there was a whole crate of this stuff, sitting in a dark corner.  
  
>You attempt to sweep the broken glass off to the side, so the next person can inspect the now slightly charred wall without hurting themselves.
