# Mining BitCoins: Money Printing?
> (Part 3 of 8 hash processor series)

Miners are getting paid for their work as auditors. They are doing the work of verifying the legitimacy of Bitcoin transactions. This convention is meant to keep Bitcoin users honest. By verifying transactions, miners are helping to prevent the "double-spending problem". 

Double spending is a scenario where a bitcoin owner illicitly spends the same bitcoin twice. With physical currency, this isn't an issue: once you hand someone a $10 bill to buy a burger, you no longer have it, so there's no way you could use that same $10 bill to buy drinks next door. While there is the possibility of counterfeit cash being made, it is different from spending the same dollar twice. 

With digital currency, there is a risk that the holder could make a copy of the digital token and send it to a merchant or another party while retaining the original. Thus miners are not really printing money, but they are getting paid for the time validating and auditing transactions using Bitcoin, helping to ensure the legitimacy of each and every transaction.
