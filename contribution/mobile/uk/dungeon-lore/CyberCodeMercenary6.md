# The Cyber Code Mercenaries
> (part 6 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

Shortly after World War 3, the World Government Organization (WGO) was formed to ensure the nuclear tragedy that converted 27% of the earth into a nuclear wasteland is never repeated again. With the formation of a central world government, people that oppose the unification of the world political system would inevitably form resistances and rebel organizations all over the world. Determined resistance groups would often utilize illegal and dangerous bionic and cybernetic modifications to enhance their physical and mental capabilities above what the standard military soldier would have. The WGO felt the need for an elite combat unit that could overwhelm and defeat troops with bionic and cybernetic enhancements. After considering their options, they came upon some classified documents regarding a military project called "Cyber Code Project". Upon making that discovery, massive funds were allocated to begin augmenting soldiers with the research results from the project. The resulting soldiers who received superhuman strength with super fast decision making, reaction times, and near immortality are called The Cyber Code Mercenaries.
