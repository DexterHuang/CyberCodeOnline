>You notice something stuck to a wall. You walk closer and discover a bunch of posters stuck to the wall. These posters feature crudely drawn portraits of a group of people, each with their own poster title "WANTED". A man with messy hair and smoking a cigarette. Another man with short, almost buzz cut hair and a scar on his face. A mild-looking girl with a sweet smile. A mischievous boy with a big grin and a straw hat. A bear with.... antlers? You had to look twice. You aren't sure what you are seeing. Surely if they were wanted criminals the SLPD would have already found them.  
  
>You leave the posters alone on the wall. Maybe the next person that finds these will have a better idea where these people on the posters can be found.
