# The New Breed of Superhumans Among Us
> (part 5 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

After numerous failed experiments causing the loss of multiple human lives, the first super soldier was finally created on 29th October 2062. Equipped with a full titanium alloy endoskeleton, fully reconfigurable modular limbs, replaceable optical and acoustic sensors, military grade Cerebral Accelerator, and an always online neural backup with multiple backup bodies spread among multiple military bases, the result of the Cyber Code Project is just short of an immortal super soldier. The only way to permanently kill them is to destroy all 262 Cyber Code backup plants within the 10 seconds needed for a full cerebral backup. This marks the first creation of the first super soldier in history. 

After the success of the Cyber Code Project was picked up by the World Government Organization, a massive amount of funding was allocated to begin augmenting soldiers with the research results from the Cyber Code Project. The group of elite soldiers who received superhuman strength with super fast decision making and reaction times were called The Cyber Code Mercenaries.
