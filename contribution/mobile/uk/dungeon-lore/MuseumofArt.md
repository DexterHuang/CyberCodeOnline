Come and visit Shangri-La Museum of Modern Art to witness a new unique and rare exhibit. The item in this exhibit was first sold at a public anonymous auction for a staggering 14 million BitCoins. The previous owner, who wished to remain anonymous, donated it so that everyone could finally witness the resplendence of this exhibit!

This artifact was a piece of costume worn by the super pop star Epic Dexter, well known for wearing unique, daring, and sometimes scantily clad outfits on stage and subsequently auctioning them for charity. Last year, Epic Dexter did his first worldwide tour called Epic Dexter's Tour of Life, commemorating his 100th album and receiving his Golden Record award. During his concert in Shangri-La, he accidentally slipped on stage while singing his top-selling single "Cybernetic Potato" and ripped part of his costume in front of 500 million viewers, resulting in this priceless historical artifact. Come and see the "Epic Dexter's Compromised G-string of Life" exhibit with your own eyes and gaze upon this artifact of Shangri-La's rich history!
