While hacking through a random dudes desktop, you find a folder suspiciously named 'Do not open'.    Behind that folder you find,<br> another folder, <br> then another. <br> Until finally, you find an audio transcript. <Br> We're no strangers to love
<br>You know the rules and so do I
<br>A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
<br>You wouldn't get this from any other guy
<br>I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
<br>Gotta make you understand
<br>Never gonna give you up
<br>Never gonna let you down
<br>Never gonna run around and desert you
<br>Never gonna make you cry
<br>Never gonna say goodbye
<br>Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
<br>We've known each other for so long
<br>Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
<br>Inside we both know what's been going on
<br>We know the game and we're gonna play it
<br>And if you ask me how I'm feeling
<br>Don't tell me you're too blind to see
<br>Never gonna give you up
<br>Never gonna let you down
<br>Never gonna run around and desert you
<br>Never gonna make you cry
<br>Never gonna say goodbye
<br>Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
<br>Never gonna give you up
<br>Never gonna let you down
<br>Never gonna run around and desert you
<br>Never gonna make you cry
<br>Never gonna say goodbye
<br>Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
<br>Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
<br>We've known each other for so long

<br>You aren't sure what the point of the audio was. Seemed to be some old song from pre-singularity. Whatever it was, it just wasted 5 minutes of your time.
