# The Adoption of Hash Processors to Mine BitCoin
> (Part 5 of 8 hash processor series)

Since the invention and mass production of Quantum Processing Units (QPU) by Maikon Quantum Semiconductors [MQS] in 2057, they have held the monopoly for the majority of Bitcoin mined. The old technology available to the public just cannot compete with the overwhelming difference in performance against the new QPU technology. After the WGO finally declared BitCoin as the world currency, they declared a new law that all mining equipment must be regulated in power and speed, and conform to strict quality standards. The new standardized BitCoin mining tool is called a Hash Processor. They are produced by Maikon under the instruction and design from WGO. Hash Processors are designed to be a disposable item, where you synchronize it with your Cerebral Accelerator and it operates for 15 minutes before it is spent. At the end of the 15 minute cycle the Hash Processor generates BitCoin that is transferred to the user's wallet.
