>Stepping carefully into the room, you spot a pile of something wooden. And a flat board. Not passing up the chance to take a break, you gingerly step towards the pile.  
  
>You find a wooden board, with some wooden puzzle pieces. A puzzle set left in the middle of nowhere. You wonder if someone was playing with it and left it behind in a hurry. You look at the pieces of the puzzle. One is shaped like the letter "L", another piece is shaped like the letter "t". In total, there are seven different puzzle pieces here. The wooden puzzle board is divided up with faded white lines. It seems the objective of the game is to somehow fit the seven pieces perfectly on the board. You spend a few minutes trying to figure out the puzzle before giving up.  
  
>You leave the puzzle set on the ground, letting it entrap its next victim, dangling the solution just out of reach.
