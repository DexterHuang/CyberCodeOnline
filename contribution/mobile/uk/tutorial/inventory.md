# Inventory
You can access your **Inventory** by clicking the option at the bottom menu bar. In your inventory, you can see all items that you own, ranging from **Equipment** (which also includes **Upgrade Modules** and **Equipment Caches**), **Ammo**, **Medical Items**, **Crafting Ingredients**, **Key Fragment / Secret Keys**, **Global Boost**, and other consumables. By clicking on the item, you can see the details and lores of that item respectively.

## Functionality on Inventory
Here's a few tips that players can utilize around inventory feature, as follows:

> By clicking the icons above your inventory list, you can filter out specific items. This option ranged from alphabetical sort up to item filter.

> You will start with 50 inventory slots; equipping **Backpack** or gear / upgrade modules with **pocket** stat will give you more inventory space. 

> To get rid of equipment and upgrade modules, you can click on the item itself and then on the **Scrap** button. Alternatively, you can hold click on one item, select every item you want to scrap, then press the **Scrap** button that will appear at the top left of the item list. 

> There's a dedicated **Auto Scrap** button which players can find by clicking the dropdown button on the right side of the filter icon. Auto Scrap will only be scrapping Common or Trash rarity gear while ignoring any Upgrade Module of any rarity.

> Every item that the player can scrap will yield **Tech Scrap** in return. However, some item does give you other items such as **Medical Tech Parts** (which can only be gained by scrapping **Pain Away**) or **Ammunition Tech Parts** (which can only be gained by scrapping either **Anti Matter Charge** or **Energy Cell**). Not only that, some items (such as Pain Away and **Equipment Caches**) aren't guaranteed to yield either Tech Scrap or Med Tech, with a 50% chance to yield one.

> To get rid of other items that are not scrappable, you can click on the **Destroy** button. Destroyed items will not give you anything in return, so be cautious when performing this action.  

## Item Inbox
Items that other players send (or sent back from **Player Market** & claimed from **Daily Reward**) will automatically be placed in your **Item Inbox**. Once you have enough space in your inventory, they will be moved automatically to your inventory by clicking **Get All Items** option. Keep in mind that items stored in Item Inbox will expire in 7 days if not claimed. 

## Crafting
Crafting allows you to craft different types of items such as **Medicine**, **Ammo**, **Item Ingredient**, and other consumables (such as **Hash Processor** and **AI Core**).  

On Medical Tab, most heal item relies on **Medical Tech Parts** and **Medical Science Level** to craft one. For example, to craft 4 Nano Medic Bot, players need to have 8 Medical Tech Parts while also on a Medical Science level 30 (or higher). Some heal items will also require **Tech Scrap** in order to make a **Medical Drone** version of it. For example, in order to make Nano Medic Drone, players must have both Nano Medic Bot and Tech Scrap on their inventory (while also on a Medical Science level 40 (or higher)). 

On Ammo Tab, each ammo requires a different ingredient to craft. For **Energy Cells**, a player must have **Ammunition Tech Parts** to make one, and as for **Anti Matter Charge**, plater must have **Military Ammunition Tech Parts**. Players can also make Military Ammunition Tech Parts by combining a minimum of 20 Ammunition Tech Parts to make one. Since there are only two types of ammo, the role of **Ammo Crafting Skill** revolves around the ammo quantity that the player can get per 10 levels. For example, on Ammo Crafting Level 20, players can get 3 Energy Cells for every 1 Ammunition Tech Parts (3:1 ratio), and by level 30, players will get 1 more Energy Cells with the same amount of Ammunition Tech Parts. The same case applies to making Anti Matter Charge.   

On Material Tab, players can craft **Hash Processor** and **AI Core** for their needs. Specifically for AI Core, it is advisable for players to level up their Mining Skills to level 190 first to get an even crafting rate (20 Hash Processor : 20 AI Core) as lower-level AI crafting aren't profitable while consuming even more ingredient than it's needed. This doesn't apply to Hash Processor crafting as it's always at the same rate.  

In summary, as you level up the relevant skills (Medical Science, Ammo Crafting, and Mining Skill), you will unlock new recipes and become more proficient, allowing you to craft more and better items.
