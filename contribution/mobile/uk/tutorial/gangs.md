# Gangs
**Gangs** are a great way to join forces with your friends. Members gain the ability to access gang headquarters, dungeons, and chat. Gangs can be created and joined once you're level 3. Creating a gang costs 50,000BTC and has a weekly upkeep fee of Resources and BTC.

## Gang HQ
The gang headquarters show your gang level, necessary upkeep, amount of members, and control over Shangri-La. It also has new AFK tasks and an Automatic Recycler.  

Gang level impacts how many members can be in a gang.  To level up, collect Gang EXP by doing AFK tasks such as **Gather Gang Resource** and **Decrypt Memory Shard**. There is also a dedicated leaderboard for gangs, which are ranked by gang level.

There's a weekly upkeep due for all gangs. If the upkeep quota isn't met, the gang will be automatically disbanded.  Upkeep amounts are based on the number of members the gang has, thus more members there are, the more Resources and BitCoin are needed. Minimize the amount of inactive players in your gang to keep upkeep goals lower.

## Occupation Control
Occupation gives gangs control over different areas of Shangri-La. If a gang is in the top two gangs on the **Occupation Leaderboard**, those members have access to a special task called **Collect Protection Fees**. Occupation Control is gained by performing the **Reinforce Occupation at Shangri-La** Task, which consumes one gang supply crate.  It is recommended to discuss with your gang whether you want to gather occupation points or not.

## Tech Recycler
The **Automatic Recycler** will break down various items like Med Tech, Millitary Ammo Tech Parts, or Caches and turn it into Tech Scrap. It is consider one of the most efficient way of getting Tech Scrap, that also yield more Tech Scrap per rate. Since Recycler accounts as an AFK Task, player need to consider it's task duration based on the ammount of item that needs to be turn into Tech Scrap. Not only that, some items (such as Cache) yields up to x4 times of Tech Scrap per cache with a cost of having longer task time than both Med Tech and Millitary Ammo (which only yields x1.2 times per item)   

## Hack Into Fortress
The final AFK task available to gang members is **Hack SL Data Fortress**.  This task uses **Protocol Breach Shards** to make progress on the SL-Data Fortress Breach.  Total progress can be seen in the Quest tab. When a Breach has been completed, a random 20 minute Global Buff will go into effect.  

## Gang Dungeons
Gang dungeon consumes a **Gang Invasion Order Transmitter** when being created.  After the dungeon has been created, anyone in the gang can join, regardless of their level. Enemies are 4-5x stronger than regular enemies and give 2x the exp. Bosses are guaranteed to drop a Rare Locked Container, Rare equipment, and Gang Supply Crates.

## Gang Options
