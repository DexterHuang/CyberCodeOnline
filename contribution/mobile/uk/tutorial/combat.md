## Combat

In every location you will see a list of Nearby Enemies and three Dungeons in which you can enter. Locations are separated by level groups.  To unlock new areas, you'll have to gather three key fragments from the dungeons. You can then brute force a new key with your key fragments at the Terminal (Map).
  
To fight Nearby Enemies, select any of the listed enemies to enter combat. You can't heal while fighting nearby enemies, however, you can click on **Escape** button on the top left corner of the screen to exit the battle. While inside a dungeon, clicking on the enemy, represented by an alien logo will draw you into combat with it.  

## Combat screen
  
The combat screen will show you how much health and shield you and your opponent both have, as well as the amount of ammo you have left for each of your weapons and the approximate damage they can do.  

## Primary Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped primary weapon. This weapon does not use ammo, but deals the least damage amongst the weapons among weapons of the same level and tier.

## Special Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped special weapon. Deal 120% damage if an enemy has shield, excess damage appllies to health without reduction. This weapon consumes one **Energy Cell** per shot and deals damage between a primary and desructive weapon of the same level and tier.

## Destructive Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped destructive weapon. Deal 50% damage to shields. If enemy has less shield than damage amount, excess damage will not scale back to 100%. This weapon consumes one **Antimatter Charge** per shot and deals the most damage before modifiers to shields amongst weapons of the same level and tier.

## Use Item
You have 3 Use Item slots. You can bind medical supplies, supply create or experience memories and use them. However practically you should only bind medical supplies because all items that can be immediately used work outside combat and outside dungeons, and only medical supplies need to be used in dungeons. There is no automatic sorting to slots.

You can only use items in Dungeons. This means you cannot heal when fighting nearby enemies.

## Escape
You can attempt to escape from combat by clicking Escape in the top left. The success rate for escaping combat outside of a dungeon is always 100%. However if you are fighting inside a dungeon and try to escape, the chance will be based on your escape stat which is taken from your armour and upgrade stats. If you fail to escape, you will then be attacked by the enemy without dealing any damage.  

## Death

Also named "FLATLINE", your character is rendered unable to do anything until a brief timer runs out. If you die, you won't lose any of your items. However, if your level is greater then 10, you will lose 10%  of your total BTC and Player XP. If your current XP out of full Level progress is less than 10%, you may lose a level.
  
## Enemy Modifiers
  
Enemies can have modifiers, which are indicated by an adjective before the enemies name e.g. "**Mad** Serial Killer", these modifiers are as follows,
  
 - Mad - Gives the enemy +20% damage  
 - Angry - Gives the enemy +10% damage  
 - Tough - Gives the enemy +20% defence  
   - Also gives the enemy significantly more health and slightly more damage (Not in tooltips)
 - Agile - Gives the enemy +20% stun evade and a shield  
   - The Shield amount is always equal to half of enemy's health
 - Shielded - Gives the enemy a large shield  
   - The Shield amount is always equal to double of enemy's health
   - Note however that shielded enemies have slightly lower health to compensate.
 - Precise - Gives the enemy +10% crit chance and +40% crit damage
   - Also gives the enemy a shield (Not in tooltips)
 - Berserker - Gives the enemy significantly more health, shield and damage.
   - No tooltip exists for it, but the significantly higher shield and health (which are also almost equal, except for bosses) is very easy to notice

Some important notes about modifiers:

1. The damage from enemy is multiplied by the factor, then subtracted by your armor before deducting from your health. This means enemies might deal significantly more damage than no-modifier counterparts. 
2. Similar calculation results also apply to defense. Tough enemies can take much more shots to kill.
3. Agile enemies have "Stun Evade" (i.e. Only 80% of your stun value is used, e.g. 20% stun becomes 16% stun.), rather than "Evade" (i.e. chance for your attack to not hit at all). You may need to heal slightly more from such enemies hitting you when you normally stun them, but you will not have to heal from missing a shot completely.

  
## Player Modifiers
  
You can also pick up modifiers by interacting with the quest giver in the dungeon, which is represented by a '?', these modifiers are as follows:  
  
 - Overcharged I - Gives the player +5% damage  
 - Overcharged II - Gives the player +10% damage  
 - Overcharged III - Gives the player +15% damage  
 - Overcharged IV - Gives the player +20% damage  
 - Overcharged V - Gives the player +25% damage  
  
  
 - Reinforced I - Gives the player +5% defence  
 - Reinforced II - Gives the player +10% defence  
 - Reinforced III - Gives the player +15% defence  
 - Reinforced IV - Gives the player +20% defence  
 - Reinforced V - Gives the player +25% defence  
  
  
 - Shield Enhance I - Gives the player +5% shield multiplier  
 - Shield Enhance II - Gives the player +10% shield multiplier  
 - Shield Enhance III - Gives the player +15% shield multiplier  
 - Shield Enhance IV - Gives the player +20% shield multiplier  
 - Shield Enhance V - Gives the player +25% shield multiplier  

The modifier only starts counting down when you complete the quest by exchanging the requested items on Quest Tab (yellow text when completed). You can accept a quest in a dungeon and wait until a later time to start it. Every quests reward will specify the exact modifier you will gain.

Also, player modifiers of different tiers stack additively. For example, you can have Overcharged I, Overcharged II at the same time, resulting in +15% damage. However if you gain a modifier you have already enabled (for instance, activating Overcharged I two times), it resets the timer.
