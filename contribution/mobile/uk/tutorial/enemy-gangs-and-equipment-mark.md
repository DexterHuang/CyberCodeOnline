# Enemy Gangs & Mark

![EnemyGangGraph](/resources/mobile-tutorial/EnemyGangGraph.png)

All enemies have a gang that it belongs to, as each area will have a different gang _'dominant'_ in retrospect. These gangs will affect how players approach as the enemy gang will either benefit players or make the fight even harder.

In summary, enemy gangs name & trait as follows:
- **Animals:** Increased damage to **Disruptor** players (up to 10%)

- **Voodoo Boys**: Increased damage to **Makeshift** players (up to 10%)

- **Scavengers**: Increased damage to **Lethal** players (up to 10%)

One of the few ways to know which gangs are dominating the area is through **Nearby Enemies** or surfing around **Dungeon**. By seeing their gang name on the top of its health bar, you can notify who's who very quickly. Players can still change their gear in-fight stance if they think the enemies will benefit from its **Mark** spots.

## Equipment Mark

All gear / equipment (Except backpacks & modules) has a **Mark** that attach to it, which has a different effect depending on their enemy's influence.

In summary, marks name & trait as follows:

- **Lethal**: Increase damage to **Animals** enemies (up to 10%)

- **Disruptor**: Increase damage to **Voodoo Boys** enemies (up to 10%)

- **Makeshift**: Increase damage to **Scavengers** enemies (up to 10%)

Keep in mind that every gear that players gain via print or drop either before or after **2022/01/05 update**, will have random Mark that's automaticly attached to it.

## Knowing Your Designated Mark

Every player has a different **Mark**, determined by the majority of the gear mark's that you have as your arsenal (you can see your designated **Mark** at the **Equipped** section on **Inventory** tab). For example, if your equipped gear were dominated by **Makeshift** mark, then Makeshift is your classified Mark.

Players can see the effects of having a certain amount of **Mark** by tapping the yellow Mark text on Equipped section or from the Player's stats on **Profile** tab. As the graph suggested above, every Mark will affect both gangs in a good or bad sense of ways.
