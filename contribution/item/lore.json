		"TRASH": [
			"A broken and battered ${itemName} barely held together by weak glue & strips of duct tape. True to its ${tierName} designation, it barely functions as a ${itemType}.",
			"It used to be the peak technology of its time, with very low mass manufacturing costs ${itemName} its reputation and quality. Nothing more than a ${tierName} of its fate.",
			"Nothing more than an abandoned artefact. Although, 'artefact' seems to imply some degree of significance. It could be less of an artefact than just detritus. Then again, these ${itemType} were only as 'functional' as they needed to be.",
			"It's a wonder this ${itemType} even still has most of its pieces.",

			"This is an excellent ${itemType}, and it looks great. It's in perfect size. The material is constructed of a light-weight nano-alloy that will last aeons past a typical organic lifespan.",
