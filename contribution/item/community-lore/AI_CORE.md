You turn the core over in your hand. It seems impossibly heavy for the small size, but you've seen how big they get when deployed, all spindly spider legs, cutting edges, and guns tucked away in there with enough cognition to grab the loot and run.

Outside of some experimental quantum foam weaponry, nothing is quite as regulated these days as AI Cores.  A few inadequate regulators in the earlier generations killed a whole lot of people, and scared the rest into implementing some serious oversight. You hold this one up to a bright spike of light cutting through the city's pervasive neon glow, noticing something odd about this particular core. Huh, this one seems to have the serial number filed off, and, are those signs of tampering around the manufacturer’s holo stamp? Whatever, it's probably safe to use.
