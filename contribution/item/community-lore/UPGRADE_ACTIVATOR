Honestly, you dont see these too often... A high end proprietary data storage crystal, or rather a somewhat convincing copy of one. Still, someone really did not want
whatever data this thing holds to be found out but, hey, finders-keepers right? Might as well have Komiko in Shangri-La center reverse engineer it. No one would go 
through something as complicated as copying one of these, one fiber set delicately into the crystal's matrix at a time unless there was something somebody was ready to
pay dearly for. Etched into the top of the housing are the words : "Glaz Security Corp. #1874: Part 14"
