Printing level:

Printing level determines the level of the equipment you will print. For example, if you have a printing level of 10, you will only print lvl 10 equipment. 

Things to note and related information:
Printing level can never go higher than your actual level. 
You can't equip items that are higher than your level.

How to level up printing skills:
1. Printing equipments(decent but not the most efficient) 
2. Reverse Engineering in Job Hub (uses Tech Scraps but is efficient)
3. Printing AFK Tasks in Job Hub (not efficient)

General Tips:
Level up your printing to the highest it can be (your main level) before printing the items you want to print.
Print trashes and commons first to level up your printing. You can scrap the unwanted equipment later for Tech Scraps.
