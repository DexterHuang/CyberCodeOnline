### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your Trash caches, as they cost the least to print.  

2. AFK Printing Jobs. In the Commercial Area there is an AFK job that increases your printing rank.  

3. Reverse engineer Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is an AFK job called Reverse Engineer Scraps which uses tech scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fasters way to increase your rank, and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches and then scrap them for tech scraps)

In every area with enemies there is there is an action called AFK Resource Gathering, near the bottom of the panel.

Bargain gives you better deals in the Weapon Smith and the Trinoky Mart, which can be found in the Centeral Hub. You can sell your items for better prices and buy items cheaper.
