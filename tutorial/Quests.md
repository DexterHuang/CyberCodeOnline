## Quests
Quests can be found on the Explorer tab, in the left-hand column. Here is where you are given specific tasks that will earn you extra experience points and bitcoin. There are a variety of tasks available, such as printing equipment, killing enemies, and gaining experience or bitcoin.

Hovering over the individual quest will show you what you have to do to achieve it. For example, a Gain experience quest may want you to get 1000 experience points. You'll be able to see your total by hovering, and it may say something like 125 / 1000 (12%).

Once you have completed a quest, a Claim button will appear on the quest. Click on that to get your reward, and get a new quest.
