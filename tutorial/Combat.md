## Combat

In every adventure location, you'll see a list of Nearby Enemies, as well as two Dungeons you can enter. The areas are separated by level groups, when you complete all three normal dungeon levels you should have three keys which you can use to unlock the next area.

Click on any of the listed enemies to enter combat. When in a dungeon, clicking on an enemy, represented by a '@' will draw you into combat with it.  
  
Combat is turn based. The amount of damage done is determined by timing, with the aim to time it so that it the line in the yellow section of the bar. There are different options that you can choose during a combat.

## Primary Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped primary weapon. No ammo consumed.

## Special Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped special weapon. Consumes one energy cell for each shot.

## Destructive Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped destructive weapon. Consumes one antimatter charge.

## Use Item
This option is only available in dungeons. You are able to select from medical items to heal yourself and other players to outlast the enemies. (Healing yourself does not cause your opponent to attack you.) You are also able to use xp memories to level up your player if you so choose.

## Escape
With this option you can try to escape from combat. The success rate of escaping combat outside a dungeon is 100%. However if you are fighting inside a dungeon and try to escape, the chance will be based on your escape % which is taken from your armour and upgrade stats. If you fail to escape, you will then be attacked by the enemy without dealing any damage.  
  
The combat screen will show you how much health and shield you and your opponent both have, as well as the amount of ammo you have for each of your weapons and the approximate damage they can do.
