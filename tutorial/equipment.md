## Equipment
You can equip gear that you own, as long as the gear level you wish to equip is not higher than your current player level. All equipment is divided into rarities:

 1. Trash (grey)
 2. Common (white)
 3. High Quality (green)
 4. Rare (yellow)
 5. Legendary (purplish pink)
 6. Epic (Red)

Higher level equipment will give better stats and usually more module upgrade slots.

## Upgrade Modules

You can install upgrade modules on your equipment, but the level of the module upgrade must not be higher than the equipment level. You can remove modules at any time you want by tapping on the installed module. All upgrade modules have rarities, the same as equipments. It is always best to check the quality and stats of any upgrade module as the rarity doesn't play a big part. But a higher level upgrade will usually be better than a lower level one.

You can use the player market to purchase specific items once you are above player level 5.

## Consumables

### Caches
You can obtain gear and upgrade module caches. Caches can be used to print gears equivalent to your current printing level. All caches are divided by quality, please see the above for reference. Items printed will share the same quality as the selected caches.
