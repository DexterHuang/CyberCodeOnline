## Dungeons
When in a dungeon you can click on the `Send invite to global chat` button and an invite message will appear in chat. Anyone around your level can then join you and help out. You can also click the link in chat that allows you to join other people's dungeons. If the person's level is too high, they can only be there to cheer you on but not interact. When an enemy is killed with help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance of a reward. 

Upon defeating all of the monsters, loot is different for each individual player so crates cannot be stolen by other players!

In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, the player's level needs to be at least 10 levels below or at most 12 levels above than the dungeon level. That is to say the level entrance requirement is:

`dungeon level - 10` < `player level` < `dungeon level + 12`

## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private area for a group of up to 32 friends to communicate but there are future plans for more to come of this.
