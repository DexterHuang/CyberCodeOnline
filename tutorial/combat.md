## Combat

*Planning to add link to this page from `surroundingTutorial.ts` and add a lot more screenshots/tips.*

<br />

In every location, there are enemies you can fight. You'll see a list of Nearby Enemies, as well as multiple Dungeons you can enter.

<br />

Click on any of the listed enemies to enter combat. Or, click on `scanNearbyEnemies` to refresh the list.

<br />

The combat screen will show you how much health and shield you and your opponent both have, as well as the amount of ammo you have for each of your weapons and the approximate damage they can do.
