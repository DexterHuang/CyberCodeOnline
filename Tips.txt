// one line one tip :)

// Equipment, Items, Crafting, Shops
You can sell your items in the player market.
You can repair all your damaged equipped gear at the Weaponsmith.
Your inventory has a storage limit; keep an eye on it or you will lose loot.
Dungeons are a great source of Ai Cores and Hash Processors.
Scavenge to find components for crafting ammo and medicine.
The level of the items you print are the same as your printing rank.
Detach upgrade modules when switching equipped gear to make them available for new gear.
Gear and upgrades "of expansion" increase your inventory size!
Some medicines such as Pain Away Spray heal your teammates as well!
Equipment caches come in 6 rarities: Trash, Common, High Quality, Rare, Legendary and Epic.
BTC in this game isn't redeemable; it's just in-game currency. :'(
You can store excess upgrade modules in high-quality pocketed equipment to save inventory space.
Dying a lot? Level up your printing rank to your player rank and then print new equipment!
I bet you haven't even looked at things like your Inventory or Crafting yet.
Confused about the cache that just fell into your hand? Go to the Molecular Printer and print some gear.
Always carry medical and ammo parts on you so are able to craft while in a dungeon.
Epic caches are extremely rare. Consider yourself lucky if you get one.
Low on BTC? Get some by crypto mining with some Hash Processors, at the [JOB HUB].
A higher Scavenge skill allows you to scavenge in higher level stations and get many more items.
Secret Key Fragments appear in both normal and challenge dungeons, while Experience Memories only appear in challenge dungeons.
While Antimatter Charges aren't exactly rare, they aren't easy to come by either; one shouldn't use it at every single encounter.
Always check the market prices before putting something up for sale!
You need a lot of Tech Scraps to open a locked container.
Scrap your unused items to get Tech Scraps; you will need them to open locked containers.
You can machine craft more Tech Scraps at the [GANG] via Automatic Recycler.
If you need BTC, try selling unwanted items to the Weaponsmith.  The "Bargaining" stat helps with this.
Inventory getting full?  Lost BTC when you flatlined?  Store items or BTC in the [BANK OF ARASAKA].
Need more space in your inventory? Obtain 100 Tech Scrap and head on over to Lee's Trading Post.
Need more Tech Scrap?  Watch chat for dungeon messages and join up!


// Experience, Leveling
Scrap your items to get Tech Scraps, then reverse engineer them to gain printing exp.
Your crafting ranks cannot exceed your level; don't waste time doing crafting research when you're capped.
You can reverse engineer scraps at [JOB HUB] to gain printing exp.
"Trash" quality equipment is useful for getting tech scraps and printing exp.
Want to level up a skill and got some time to spare? Pick up an odd job in the Commercial area.
Study shows that mobs with the "Agile" tag grants more exp.
Not leveling as fast as you'd like? Try dungeon diving! (You get 2x more exp)
The gear you get from the [MOLECULAR PRINTER] is always based on your Printing level and not on your overall one, so make sure you always keep your printing level caught up.
To keep the game fair and content relevant, after a certain level, it's impossible to gain exp and loot from lower-leveled enemies or dungeons.
Fight enemies and dungeons above your level for more juicy exp.
Calibrating gear makes it stronger, but calibrated gear cannot be gifted or sold.
Each level of calibration on gear adds more to the item than the last level, but is more likely to break the item as well.

// Combat, Enemies, Allies
HP goes back to full after each battle, unless you're in a dungeon!
You will always recover to full health while not in a dungeon.
You always attack first, so make good use of that advantage!
Shields regenerate after you defeat an enemy in the dungeon.
Craft Pain Away to be able to recover health between fights in dungeons.
Beware of enemies with extra descriptors such as tough, angry or shielded.
Enemies with descriptors (e.g., Shielded / Mad / Angry) are tougher, but they give better rewards!
Secret keys are needed to access higher level stations; search dungeons for their fragments!
Remember the CCO mantra: Hit, Heal, Hit.
Challenge dungeons always have a tough boss so don't forget to bring your friends with you when venturing in.
When you die, you'll lose some of your experience and 10% of your Bitcoins, so be careful!
Use only primary weapons to overpower street monsters to save ammo.
You can't enter a dungeon that is 10 levels above your level. It's for your own good.
Spamming keys can lead into trouble, such as unintentional attacks or heal. Keep calm and don't spam.
There are healing items called "Sprays" that not only heal you, but also heal other players fighting the same enemy as you!
Shileds always regen between fights in dungeons.
